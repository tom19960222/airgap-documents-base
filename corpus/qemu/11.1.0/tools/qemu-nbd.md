# QEMU Disk Network Block Device Server

## Synopsis

**qemu-nbd** [*OPTION*]… *filename*

**qemu-nbd** -L [*OPTION*]…

**qemu-nbd** -d *dev*

## Description

Export a QEMU disk image using the NBD protocol.

Other uses:

- Bind a /dev/nbdX block device to a QEMU server (on Linux).
- As a client to query exports of a remote NBD server.

## Options

*filename* is a disk image filename, or a set of block
driver options if [`--image-opts`](qemu-nbd.md#cmdoption-qemu-nbd-image-opts) is specified.

*dev* is an NBD device.

--object type,id=ID,...
:   Define a new instance of the *type* object class identified by *ID*.
    See the *qemu(1)* manual page for full details of the properties
    supported. The common object types that it makes sense to define are the
    `secret` object, which is used to supply passwords and/or encryption
    keys, and the `tls-creds` object, which is used to supply TLS
    credentials for the `qemu-nbd` server or client.

-p, --port=PORT
:   TCP port to listen on as a server, or connect to as a client
    (default `10809`).

-o, --offset=OFFSET
:   The offset into the image.

-b, --bind=IFACE
:   The interface to bind to as a server, or connect to as a client
    (default `0.0.0.0`).

-k, --socket=PATH
:   Use a unix socket with path *PATH*.

--image-opts
:   Treat *filename* as a set of image options, instead of a plain
    filename. If this flag is specified, the `-f` flag should
    not be used, instead the `format=` option should be set.

-f, --format=FMT
:   Force the use of the block driver for format *FMT* instead of
    auto-detecting.

-r, --read-only
:   Export the disk as read-only.

-A, --allocation-depth
:   Expose allocation depth information via the
    `qemu:allocation-depth` metadata context accessible through
    NBD_OPT_SET_META_CONTEXT.

-B, --bitmap=NAME
:   If *filename* has a qcow2 persistent bitmap *NAME*, expose
    that bitmap via the `qemu:dirty-bitmap:NAME` metadata context
    accessible through NBD_OPT_SET_META_CONTEXT.

-s, --snapshot
:   Use *filename* as an external snapshot, create a temporary
    file with `backing_file=`*filename*, redirect the write to
    the temporary one.

-l, --load-snapshot=SNAPSHOT_PARAM
:   Load an internal snapshot inside *filename* and export it
    as an read-only device, SNAPSHOT_PARAM format is
    `snapshot.id=[ID],snapshot.name=[NAME]` or `[ID_OR_NAME]`

--cache=CACHE
:   The cache mode to be used with the file. Valid values are:
    `none`, `writeback` (the default), `writethrough`,
    `directsync` and `unsafe`. See the documentation of
    the emulator’s `-drive cache=...` option for more info.

-n, --nocache
:   Equivalent to [`--cache=none`](qemu-nbd.md#cmdoption-qemu-nbd-cache).

--aio=AIO
:   Set the asynchronous I/O mode between `threads` (the default),
    `native` (Linux only), and `io_uring` (Linux 5.1+).

--discard=DISCARD
:   Control whether `discard` (also known as `trim` or `unmap`)
    requests are ignored or passed to the filesystem. *DISCARD* is one of
    `ignore` (or `off`), `unmap` (or `on`). The default is
    `ignore`.

--detect-zeroes=DETECT_ZEROES
:   Control the automatic conversion of plain zero writes by the OS to
    driver-specific optimized zero write commands. *DETECT_ZEROES* is one of
    `off`, `on`, or `unmap`. `unmap`
    converts a zero write to an unmap operation and can only be used if
    *DISCARD* is set to `unmap`. The default is `off`.

-c, --connect=DEV
:   Connect *filename* to NBD device *DEV* (Linux only).

-d, --disconnect
:   Disconnect the device *DEV* (Linux only).

-e, --shared=NUM
:   Allow up to *NUM* clients to share the device (default
    `1`), 0 for unlimited.

-t, --persistent
:   Don’t exit on the last connection.

-x, --export-name=NAME
:   Set the NBD volume export name (default of a zero-length string).

-D, --description=DESCRIPTION
:   Set the NBD volume export description, as a human-readable
    string.

--handshake-limit=N
:   Set the timeout for a client to successfully complete its handshake
    to N seconds (default 10), or 0 for no limit.

-L, --list
:   Connect as a client and list all details about the exports exposed by
    a remote NBD server. This enables list mode, and is incompatible
    with options that change behavior related to a specific export (such as
    [`--export-name`](qemu-nbd.md#cmdoption-qemu-nbd-x), [`--offset`](qemu-nbd.md#cmdoption-qemu-nbd-o), …).

--tls-creds=ID
:   Enable mandatory TLS encryption for the server by setting the ID
    of the TLS credentials object previously created with the
    [`--object`](qemu-nbd.md#cmdoption-qemu-nbd-object) option; or provide the credentials needed for
    connecting as a client in list mode.

--tls-hostname=hostname
:   When validating an x509 certificate received over a TLS connection,
    the hostname that the NBD client used to connect will be checked
    against information in the server provided certificate. Sometimes
    it might be required to override the hostname used to perform this
    check. For example, if the NBD client is using a tunnel from localhost
    to connect to the remote server, the [`--tls-hostname`](qemu-nbd.md#cmdoption-qemu-nbd-tls-hostname) option should
    be used to set the officially expected hostname of the remote NBD
    server. This can also be used if accessing NBD over a UNIX socket
    where there is no inherent hostname available. This is only permitted
    when acting as a NBD client with the [`--list`](qemu-nbd.md#cmdoption-qemu-nbd-L) option.

--fork
:   Fork off the server process and exit the parent once the server is running.

--pid-file=PATH
:   Store the server’s process ID in the given file.

--tls-authz=ID
:   Specify the ID of a qauthz object previously created with the
    [`--object`](qemu-nbd.md#cmdoption-qemu-nbd-object) option. This will be used to authorize connecting users
    against their x509 distinguished name.

-v, --verbose
:   Display extra debugging information. This option also keeps the original
    *STDERR* stream open if the `qemu-nbd` process is daemonized due to
    other options like [`--fork`](qemu-nbd.md#cmdoption-qemu-nbd-fork) or [`-c`](qemu-nbd.md#cmdoption-qemu-nbd-c).

-h, --help
:   Display this help and exit.

-V, --version
:   Display version information and exit.

-T, --trace [[enable=]PATTERN][,events=FILE][,file=FILE]
:   Specify tracing options.

    `[enable=]PATTERN`

    > Immediately enable events matching *PATTERN*
    > (either event name or a globbing pattern). This option is only
    > available if QEMU has been compiled with the `simple`, `log`
    > or `ftrace` tracing backend. To specify multiple events or patterns,
    > specify the `-trace` option multiple times.
    >
    > Use `-trace help` to print a list of names of trace points.

    `events=FILE`

    > Immediately enable events listed in *FILE*.
    > The file must contain one event name (as listed in the `trace-events-all`
    > file) per line; globbing patterns are accepted too. This option is only
    > available if QEMU has been compiled with the `simple`, `log` or
    > `ftrace` tracing backend.

    `file=FILE`

    > Log output traces to *FILE*.
    > This option is only available if QEMU has been compiled with
    > the `simple` tracing backend.

## Examples

Start a server listening on port 10809 that exposes only the
guest-visible contents of a qcow2 file, with no TLS encryption, and
with the default export name (an empty string). The command is
one-shot, and will block until the first successful client
disconnects:

```
qemu-nbd -f qcow2 file.qcow2
```

Start a long-running server listening with encryption on port 10810,
and allow clients with a specific X.509 certificate to connect to
a 1 megabyte subset of a raw file, using the export name ‘subset’:

```
qemu-nbd \
  --object tls-creds-x509,id=tls0,endpoint=server,dir=/path/to/qemutls \
  --object 'authz-simple,id=auth0,identity=CN=laptop.example.com,,\
            O=Example Org,,L=London,,ST=London,,C=GB' \
  --tls-creds tls0 --tls-authz auth0 \
  -t -x subset -p 10810 \
  --image-opts driver=raw,offset=1M,size=1M,file.driver=file,file.filename=file.raw
```

Serve a read-only copy of a guest image over a Unix socket with as
many as 5 simultaneous readers, with a persistent process forked as a
daemon:

```
qemu-nbd --fork --persistent --shared=5 --socket=/path/to/sock \
  --read-only --format=qcow2 file.qcow2
```

Expose the guest-visible contents of a qcow2 file via a block device
/dev/nbd0 (and possibly creating /dev/nbd0p1 and friends for
partitions found within), then disconnect the device when done.
Access to bind `qemu-nbd` to a /dev/nbd device generally requires root
privileges, and may also require the execution of `modprobe nbd`
to enable the kernel NBD client module. *CAUTION*: Do not use
this method to mount filesystems from an untrusted guest image - a
malicious guest may have prepared the image to attempt to trigger
kernel bugs in partition probing or file system mounting.

```
qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 -f qcow2 file.qcow2
qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0
```

Query a remote server to see details about what export(s) it is
serving on port 10809, and authenticating via PSK:

```
qemu-nbd \
  --object tls-creds-psk,id=tls0,dir=/tmp/keys,username=eblake,endpoint=client \
  --tls-creds tls0 -L -b remote.example.com
```
