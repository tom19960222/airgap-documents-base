# MIPS System emulator

Four executables cover simulation of 32 and 64-bit MIPS systems in both
endian options, `qemu-system-mips`, `qemu-system-mipsel`
`qemu-system-mips64` and `qemu-system-mips64el`. Five different
machine types are emulated:

- The MIPS Malta prototype board "malta"
- An ACER Pica "pica61". This machine needs the 64-bit emulator.
- A MIPS Magnum R4000 machine "magnum". This machine needs the
  64-bit emulator.

The Malta emulation supports the following devices:

- Core board with MIPS 24Kf CPU and Galileo system controller
- PIIX4 PCI/USB/SMbus controller
- The Multi-I/O chip’s serial device
- PCI network cards (PCnet32 and others)
- Malta FPGA serial device
- Cirrus (default) or any other PCI VGA graphics card

The Boston board emulation supports the following devices:

- Xilinx FPGA, which includes a PCIe root port and an UART
- Intel EG20T PCH connects the I/O peripherals, but only the SATA bus
  is emulated

The ACER Pica emulation supports:

- MIPS R4000 CPU
- PC-style IRQ and DMA controllers
- PC Keyboard
- IDE controller

The MIPS Magnum R4000 emulation supports:

- MIPS R4000 CPU
- PC-style IRQ controller
- PC Keyboard
- SCSI controller
- G364 framebuffer

The Fuloong 2E emulation supports:

- Loongson 2E CPU
- Bonito64 system controller as North Bridge
- VT82C686 chipset as South Bridge
- RTL8139D as a network card chipset

The Loongson-3 virtual platform emulation supports:

- Loongson 3A CPU
- LIOINTC as interrupt controller
- GPEX and virtio as peripheral devices

## Supported CPU model configurations on MIPS hosts

QEMU supports variety of MIPS CPU models:

### Supported CPU models for MIPS32 hosts

The following CPU models are supported for use on MIPS32 hosts.
Administrators / applications are recommended to use the CPU model that
matches the generation of the host CPUs in use. In a deployment with a
mixture of host CPU models between machines, if live migration
compatibility is required, use the newest CPU model that is compatible
across all desired hosts.

## nanoMIPS System emulator

Executable `qemu-system-mipsel` also covers simulation of 32-bit
nanoMIPS system in little endian mode:

- nanoMIPS I7200 CPU

Example of `qemu-system-mipsel` usage for nanoMIPS is shown below:

Download `<disk_image_file>` from
<https://mipsdistros.mips.com/LinuxDistro/nanomips/buildroot/index.html>.

Download `<kernel_image_file>` from

Start system emulation of Malta board with nanoMIPS I7200 CPU:

```
qemu-system-mipsel -cpu I7200 -kernel <kernel_image_file> \
    -M malta -serial stdio -m <memory_size> -drive file=<disk_image_file>,format=raw \
    -append "mem=256m@0x0 rw console=ttyS0 vga=cirrus vesa=0x111 root=/dev/sda"
```
