# Using and developing module utilities

Ansible provides a number of module utilities, or snippets of shared code, that
provide helper functions you can use when developing your own modules. The
`basic.py` module utility provides the main entry point for accessing the
Ansible library, and all Python Ansible modules must import something from
`ansible.module_utils`. A common option is to import `AnsibleModule`:

```python
from ansible.module_utils.basic import AnsibleModule
```

The `ansible.module_utils` namespace is not a plain Python package: it is
constructed dynamically for each task invocation, by extracting imports and
resolving those matching the namespace against a [search path](overview_architecture.md#ansible-search-path) derived from the
active configuration.

To reduce the maintenance burden in a collection or in local modules, you can extract
duplicated code into one or more module utilities and import them into your modules. For example, if you have your own custom modules that import a `my_shared_code` library, you can place that into a `./module_utils/my_shared_code.py` file like this:

```python
from ansible.module_utils.my_shared_code import MySharedCodeClient
```

When you run `ansible-playbook`, Ansible will merge any files in your local `module_utils` directories into the `ansible.module_utils` namespace in the order defined by the [Ansible search path](overview_architecture.md#ansible-search-path).

## Naming and finding module utilities

You can generally tell what a module utility does from its name and/or its location. Generic utilities (shared code used by many different kinds of modules) live in the main ansible/ansible codebase, in the `common` subdirectory or in the root directory of `lib/ansible/module_utils`. Utilities used by a particular set of modules generally live in the same collection as those modules. For example:

- `lib/ansible/module_utils/urls.py` contains shared code for parsing URLs
- `openstack.cloud.plugins.module_utils.openstack.py` contains utilities for modules that work with OpenStack instances
- `ansible.netcommon.plugins.module_utils.network.common.config.py` contains utility functions for use by networking modules

Following this pattern with your own module utilities makes everything easy to find and use.

## Standard module utilities

Ansible ships with an extensive library of `module_utils` files. You can find the module utility source code in the `lib/ansible/module_utils` directory under your main Ansible path. We describe the most widely used utilities below. For more details on any specific module utility, please see the [source code for module_utils](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/lib/ansible/module_utils).

> **Note:**
>
> **LICENSING REQUIREMENTS** Ansible enforces the following licensing requirements:
>
> - Utilities (files in `lib/ansible/module_utils/`) may have one of two licenses:
>   :   - A file in `module_utils` used **only** for a specific vendor’s hardware, provider, or service may be licensed under GPLv3+.
>         Adding a new file under `module_utils` with GPLv3+ needs to be approved by the core team.
>       - All other `module_utils` must be licensed under BSD, so GPL-licensed third-party and Galaxy modules can use them.
>       - If there’s doubt about the appropriate license for a file in `module_utils`, the Ansible Core Team will decide during an Ansible Core Community Meeting.
> - All other files shipped with Ansible, including all modules, must be licensed under the GPL license (GPLv3 or later).
> - Existing license requirements still apply to content in ansible/ansible (ansible-core).
> - Content that was previously in ansible/ansible or a collection and has moved to a new collection must retain the license it had in its prior repository.
> - Copyright entries by previous committers must also be kept in any moved files.

Several commonly-used utilities migrated to collections in Ansible 2.10, including:

- `ismount.py` migrated to `ansible.posix.plugins.module_utils.mount.py` - Single helper function that fixes os.path.ismount
- `known_hosts.py` migrated to `community.general.plugins.module_utils.known_hosts.py` - utilities for working with known_hosts file
