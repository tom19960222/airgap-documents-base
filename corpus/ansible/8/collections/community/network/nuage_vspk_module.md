## [Synopsis](nuage_vspk_module.md#id1)

- Manage or find Nuage VSP entities, this includes create, update, delete, assign, unassign and find, with all supported properties.

Aliases: network.nuage.nuage_vspk

## [Requirements](nuage_vspk_module.md#id2)

The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- Python 2.7
- Supports Nuage VSP 4.0Rx & 5.x.y
- Proper VSPK-Python installed for your Nuage version
- Tested with NuageX <https://nuagex.io>

## [Parameters](nuage_vspk_module.md#id3)

| Parameter | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| **auth**  string / required | Dict with the authentication information required to connect to a Nuage VSP environment.  Requires a *api_username* parameter (example csproot).  Requires either a *api_password* parameter (example csproot) or a *api_certificate* and *api_key* parameters, which point to the certificate and key files for certificate based authentication.  Requires a *api_enterprise* parameter (example csp).  Requires a *api_url* parameter (example <https://10.0.0.10:8443>).  Requires a *api_version* parameter (example v4_0). |
| **children**  string | Can be used to specify a set of child entities.  A mandatory property of each child is the *type*.  Supported optional properties of each child are *id*, *properties* and *match_filter*.  The function of each of these properties is the same as in the general task definition.  This can be used recursively  Only useable in case *state=present*. |
| **command**  string | Specifies a command to be executed.  With *command=find*, if *parent_id* and *parent_type* are defined, it will only search within the parent. Otherwise, if allowed, will search in the root object.  With *command=find*, if *id* is specified, it will only return the single entity matching the id.  With *command=find*, otherwise, if *match_filter* is define, it will use that filter to search.  With *command=find*, otherwise, if *properties* are defined, it will do an AND search using all properties.  With *command=change_password*, a password of a user can be changed. Warning - In case the password is the same as the existing, it will throw an error.  With *command=wait_for_job*, the module will wait for a job to either have a status of SUCCESS or ERROR. In case an ERROR status is found, the module will exit with an error.  With *command=wait_for_job*, the job will always be returned, even if the state is ERROR situation.  Either *state* or *command* needs to be defined, both can not be defined at the same time.  **Choices:**   - `"find"` - `"change_password"` - `"wait_for_job"` - `"get_csp_enterprise"` |
| **id**  string | The ID of the entity you want to work on.  In combination with *command=find*, it will only return the single entity.  In combination with *state*, it will either update or delete this entity.  Will take precedence over *match_filter* and *properties* whenever an entity needs to be found. |
| **match_filter**  string | A filter used when looking (both in *command* and *state* for entities, in the format the Nuage VSP API expects.  If *match_filter* is defined, it will take precedence over the *properties*, but not on the *id* |
| **parent_id**  string | The ID of the parent of the entity you want to work on.  When *state* is specified, the entity will be gathered from this parent, if it exists, unless an *id* is specified.  When *command=find* is specified, the entity will be searched for in this parent, unless an *id* is specified.  If specified, *parent_type* also needs to be specified. |
| **parent_type**  string | The type of parent the ID is specified for (example Enterprise).  This should match the objects CamelCase class name in VSPK-Python.  This Class name can be found on <https://nuagenetworks.github.io/vspkdoc/index.html>.  If specified, *parent_id* also needs to be specified. |
| **properties**  string | Properties are the key, value pairs of the different properties an entity has.  If no *id* and no *match_filter* is specified, these are used to find or determine if the entity exists. |
| **state**  string | Specifies the desired state of the entity.  If *state=present*, in case the entity already exists, will update the entity if it is needed.  If *state=present*, in case the relationship with the parent is a member relationship, will assign the entity as a member of the parent.  If *state=absent*, in case the relationship with the parent is a member relationship, will unassign the entity as a member of the parent.  Either *state* or *command* needs to be defined, both can not be defined at the same time.  **Choices:**   - `"present"` - `"absent"` |
| **type**  string / required | The type of entity you want to work on (example Enterprise).  This should match the objects CamelCase class name in VSPK-Python.  This Class name can be found on <https://nuagenetworks.github.io/vspkdoc/index.html>. |

## [Notes](nuage_vspk_module.md#id4)

> **Note:**
>
> - Check mode is supported, but with some caveats. It will not do any changes, and if possible try to determine if it is able do what is requested.
> - In case a parent id is provided from a previous task, it might be empty and if a search is possible on root, it will do so, which can impact performance.
