## [Parameters](netscaler_lb_monitor_module.md#id3)

| Parameter | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| **acctapplicationid**  string | List of Acct-Application-Id attribute value pairs (AVPs) for the Capabilities-Exchange-Request (CER) message to use for monitoring Diameter servers. A maximum of eight of these AVPs are supported in a monitoring message.  Minimum value = `0`  Maximum value = `4294967295` |
| **action**  string | Action to perform when the response to an inline monitor (a monitor of type `HTTP-INLINE`) indicates that the service is down. A service monitored by an inline monitor is considered `DOWN` if the response code is not one of the codes that have been specified for the Response Code parameter.  Available settings function as follows:  \* `NONE` - Do not take any action. However, the show service command and the show lb monitor command indicate the total number of responses that were checked and the number of consecutive error responses received after the last successful probe.  \* `LOG` - Log the event in NSLOG or SYSLOG.  \* `DOWN` - Mark the service as being down, and then do not direct any traffic to the service until the configured down time has expired. Persistent connections to the service are terminated as soon as the service is marked as `DOWN`. Also, log the event in NSLOG or SYSLOG.  **Choices:**   - `"NONE"` - `"LOG"` - `"DOWN"` |
| **alertretries**  string | Number of consecutive probe failures after which the appliance generates an SNMP trap called monProbeFailed.  Minimum value = `0`  Maximum value = `32` |
| **application**  string | Name of the application used to determine the state of the service. Applicable to monitors of type `CITRIX-XML-SERVICE`.  Minimum length = 1 |
| **attribute**  string | Attribute to evaluate when the LDAP server responds to the query. Success or failure of the monitoring probe depends on whether the attribute exists in the response. Optional.  Minimum length = 1 |
| **authapplicationid**  string | List of Auth-Application-Id attribute value pairs (AVPs) for the Capabilities-Exchange-Request (CER) message to use for monitoring Diameter servers. A maximum of eight of these AVPs are supported in a monitoring CER message.  Minimum value = `0`  Maximum value = `4294967295` |
| **basedn**  string | The base distinguished name of the LDAP service, from where the LDAP server can begin the search for the attributes in the monitoring query. Required for `LDAP` service monitoring.  Minimum length = 1 |
| **binddn**  string | The distinguished name with which an LDAP monitor can perform the Bind operation on the LDAP server. Optional. Applicable to `LDAP` monitors.  Minimum length = 1 |
| **customheaders**  string | Custom header string to include in the monitoring probes. |
| **database**  string | Name of the database to connect to during authentication.  Minimum length = 1 |
| **destip**  string | IP address of the service to which to send probes. If the parameter is set to 0, the IP address of the server to which the monitor is bound is considered the destination IP address. |
| **destport**  string | TCP or UDP port to which to send the probe. If the parameter is set to 0, the port number of the service to which the monitor is bound is considered the destination port. For a monitor of type `USER`, however, the destination port is the port number that is included in the HTTP request sent to the dispatcher. Does not apply to monitors of type `PING`. |
| **deviation**  string | Time value added to the learned average response time in dynamic response time monitoring (DRTM). When a deviation is specified, the appliance learns the average response time of bound services and adds the deviation to the average. The final value is then continually adjusted to accommodate response time variations over time. Specified in milliseconds, seconds, or minutes.  Minimum value = `0`  Maximum value = `20939` |
| **dispatcherip**  string | IP address of the dispatcher to which to send the probe. |
| **dispatcherport**  string | Port number on which the dispatcher listens for the monitoring probe. |

| **downtime**  string | Time duration for which to wait before probing a service that has been marked as DOWN. Expressed in milliseconds, seconds, or minutes.  Minimum value = `1`  Maximum value = `20939` |
| **evalrule**  string | Default syntax expression that evaluates the database server’s response to a MYSQL-ECV or MSSQL-ECV monitoring query. Must produce a Boolean result. The result determines the state of the server. If the expression returns TRUE, the probe succeeds.  For example, if you want the appliance to evaluate the error message to determine the state of the server, use the rule `MYSQL.RES.ROW(10` .TEXT_ELEM(2).EQ(“MySQL”)). |
| **failureretries**  string | Number of retries that must fail, out of the number specified for the Retries parameter, for a service to be marked as DOWN. For example, if the Retries parameter is set to 10 and the Failure Retries parameter is set to 6, out of the ten probes sent, at least six probes must fail if the service is to be marked as DOWN. The default value of 0 means that all the retries must fail if the service is to be marked as DOWN.  Minimum value = `0`  Maximum value = `32` |
| **filename**  string | Name of a file on the FTP server. The appliance monitors the FTP service by periodically checking the existence of the file on the server. Applicable to `FTP-EXTENDED` monitors.  Minimum length = 1 |
