## [Parameters](iam_managed_policy_module.md#id3)

| Parameter | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| **access_key**  aliases: aws_access_key_id, aws_access_key, ec2_access_key  string | AWS access key ID.  See the AWS documentation for more information about access tokens <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys>.  The `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` or `EC2_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables may also be used in decreasing order of preference.  The *aws_access_key* and *profile* options are mutually exclusive.  The *aws_access_key_id* alias was added in release 5.1.0 for consistency with the AWS botocore SDK.  The *ec2_access_key* alias has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01.  Support for the `EC2_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01. |
| **aws_ca_bundle**  path | The location of a CA Bundle to use when validating SSL certificates.  The `AWS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable may also be used. |
| **aws_config**  dictionary | A dictionary to modify the botocore configuration.  Parameters can be found in the AWS documentation <https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/config.html#botocore.config.Config>. |
| **debug_botocore_endpoint_logs**  boolean | Use a `botocore.endpoint` logger to parse the unique (rather than total) `"resource:action"` API calls made during a task, outputing the set to the resource_actions key in the task results.

The `ANSIBLE_DEBUG_BOTOCORE_LOGS` environment variable may also be used.  **Choices:**   - `false` ← (default) - `true` |
| **endpoint_url**  aliases: ec2_url, aws_endpoint_url, s3_url  string | URL to connect to instead of the default AWS endpoints. While this can be used to connection to other AWS-compatible services the amazon.aws and community.aws collections are only tested against AWS.  The `AWS_URL` or `EC2_URL` environment variables may also be used, in decreasing order of preference.  The *ec2_url* and *s3_url* aliases have been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01.  Support for the `EC2_URL` environment variable has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01. |
| **make_default**  boolean | Make this revision the default revision.  **Choices:**   - `false` - `true` ← (default) |
| **only_version**  boolean | Remove all other non default revisions, if this is used with `make_default` it will result in all other versions of this policy being deleted.  **Choices:**   - `false` ← (default) - `true` |
| **policy**  json | A properly json formatted policy |
| **policy_description**  string | A helpful description of this policy, this value is immutable and only set when creating a new policy.  **Default:** `""` |
| **policy_name**  string / required | The name of the managed policy. |
| **profile**  aliases: aws_profile  string | A named AWS profile to use for authentication.  See the AWS documentation for more information about named profiles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html>.  The `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable may also be used.  The *profile* option is mutually exclusive with the *aws_access_key*, *aws_secret_key* and *security_token* options. |
| **region**  aliases: aws_region, ec2_region  string | The AWS region to use.  For global services such as IAM, Route53 and CloudFront, *region* is ignored.  The `AWS_REGION` or `EC2_REGION` environment variables may also be used.  See the Amazon AWS documentation for more information <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ec2_region>.  The `ec2_region` alias has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01  Support for the `EC2_REGION` environment variable has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01. |
| **secret_key**  aliases: aws_secret_access_key, aws_secret_key, ec2_secret_key  string | AWS secret access key.

The *secret_key* and *profile* options are mutually exclusive.  The *aws_secret_access_key* alias was added in release 5.1.0 for consistency with the AWS botocore SDK.  The *ec2_secret_key* alias has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01.  Support for the `EC2_SECRET_KEY` environment variable has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01. |
| **session_token**  aliases: aws_session_token, security_token, aws_security_token, access_token  string | AWS STS session token for use with temporary credentials.  See the AWS documentation for more information about access tokens <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys>.  The `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN` or `EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN` environment variables may also be used in decreasing order of preference.  The *security_token* and *profile* options are mutually exclusive.  Aliases *aws_session_token* and *session_token* were added in release 3.2.0, with the parameter being renamed from *security_token* to *session_token* in release 6.0.0.  The *security_token*, *aws_security_token*, and *access_token* aliases have been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01.  Support for the `EC2_SECRET_KEY` and `AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN` environment variables has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01. |
| **state**  string | Should this managed policy be present or absent. Set to absent to detach all entities from this policy and remove it if found.  **Choices:**   - `"present"` ← (default) - `"absent"` |
| **validate_certs**  boolean | When set to `false`, SSL certificates will not be validated for communication with the AWS APIs.  Setting *validate_certs=false* is strongly discouraged, as an alternative, consider setting *aws_ca_bundle* instead.  **Choices:**   - `false` - `true` ← (default) |

## [Notes](iam_managed_policy_module.md#id4)

> **Note:**
>
> - **Caution:** For modules, environment variables and configuration files are read from the Ansible ‘host’ context and not the ‘controller’ context. As such, files may need to be explicitly copied to the ‘host’. For lookup and connection plugins, environment variables and configuration files are read from the Ansible ‘controller’ context and not the ‘host’ context.
> - The AWS SDK (boto3) that Ansible uses may also read defaults for credentials and other settings, such as the region, from its configuration files in the Ansible ‘host’ context (typically `~/.aws/credentials`). See <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html> for more information.
