## [Parameters](elb_instance_module.md#id3)

| Parameter | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| **access_key**  aliases: aws_access_key_id, aws_access_key, ec2_access_key  string | AWS access key ID.  See the AWS documentation for more information about access tokens <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys>.  The `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` or `EC2_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables may also be used in decreasing order of preference.  The *aws_access_key* and *profile* options are mutually exclusive.  The *aws_access_key_id* alias was added in release 5.1.0 for consistency with the AWS botocore SDK.  The *ec2_access_key* alias has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01.  Support for the `EC2_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01. |
| **aws_ca_bundle**  path | The location of a CA Bundle to use when validating SSL certificates.  The `AWS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable may also be used. |
| **aws_config**  dictionary | A dictionary to modify the botocore configuration.  Parameters can be found in the AWS documentation <https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/config.html#botocore.config.Config>. |
| **debug_botocore_endpoint_logs**  boolean | Use a `botocore.endpoint` logger to parse the unique (rather than total) `"resource:action"` API calls made during a task, outputing the set to the resource_actions key in the task results. Use the `aws_resource_action` callback to output to total list made during a playbook.  The `ANSIBLE_DEBUG_BOTOCORE_LOGS` environment variable may also be used.  **Choices:**   - `false` ← (default) - `true` |
| **ec2_elbs**  list / elements=string | List of ELB names  Required when *state=present*. |
| **enable_availability_zone**  boolean | Whether to enable the availability zone of the instance on the target ELB if the availability zone has not already been enabled.  If *enable_availability_zone=no*, the task will fail if the availability zone is not enabled on the ELB.  **Choices:**   - `false` - `true` ← (default) |
| **endpoint_url**  aliases: ec2_url, aws_endpoint_url, s3_url  string | URL to connect to instead of the default AWS endpoints. While this can be used to connection to other AWS-compatible services the amazon.aws and community.aws collections are only tested against AWS.  The `AWS_URL` or `EC2_URL` environment variables may also be used, in decreasing order of preference.  The *ec2_url* and *s3_url* aliases have been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01.

| **instance_id**  string / required | EC2 Instance ID. |
| **profile**  aliases: aws_profile  string | A named AWS profile to use for authentication.  See the AWS documentation for more information about named profiles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html>.  The `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable may also be used.  The *profile* option is mutually exclusive with the *aws_access_key*, *aws_secret_key* and *security_token* options. |
| **region**  aliases: aws_region, ec2_region  string | The AWS region to use.  For global services such as IAM, Route53 and CloudFront, *region* is ignored.  The `AWS_REGION` or `EC2_REGION` environment variables may also be used.  See the Amazon AWS documentation for more information <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ec2_region>.  The `ec2_region` alias has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01  Support for the `EC2_REGION` environment variable has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01. |
| **secret_key**  aliases: aws_secret_access_key, aws_secret_key, ec2_secret_key  string | AWS secret access key.

The `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_KEY`, or `EC2_SECRET_KEY` environment variables may also be used in decreasing order of preference.  The *secret_key* and *profile* options are mutually exclusive.  The *aws_secret_access_key* alias was added in release 5.1.0 for consistency with the AWS botocore SDK.  The *ec2_secret_key* alias has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01.  Support for the `EC2_SECRET_KEY` environment variable has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01. |
| **session_token**  aliases: aws_session_token, security_token, aws_security_token, access_token  string | AWS STS session token for use with temporary credentials.

The *security_token* and *profile* options are mutually exclusive.  Aliases *aws_session_token* and *session_token* were added in release 3.2.0, with the parameter being renamed from *security_token* to *session_token* in release 6.0.0.  The *security_token*, *aws_security_token*, and *access_token* aliases have been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01.  Support for the `EC2_SECRET_KEY` and `AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN` environment variables has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01. |
| **state**  string / required | Register or deregister the instance.  **Choices:**   - `"present"` - `"absent"` |
| **validate_certs**  boolean | When set to `false`, SSL certificates will not be validated for communication with the AWS APIs.  Setting *validate_certs=false* is strongly discouraged, as an alternative, consider setting *aws_ca_bundle* instead.  **Choices:**   - `false` - `true` ← (default) |
| **wait**  boolean | Wait for instance registration or deregistration to complete successfully before returning.  **Choices:**   - `false` - `true` ← (default) |
| **wait_timeout**  integer | Number of seconds to wait for an instance to change state.  If *wait_timeout=0* then this module may return an error if a transient error occurs.  If non-zero then any transient errors are ignored until the timeout is reached.  Ignored when *wait=no*.  **Default:** `0` |

## [Notes](elb_instance_module.md#id4)

> **Note:**
>
> - The ec2_elbs fact previously set by this module was deprecated in release 2.1.0 and since release 4.0.0 is no longer set.
> - **Caution:** For modules, environment variables and configuration files are read from the Ansible ‘host’ context and not the ‘controller’ context. As such, files may need to be explicitly copied to the ‘host’. For lookup and connection plugins, environment variables and configuration files are read from the Ansible ‘controller’ context and not the ‘host’ context.
> - The AWS SDK (boto3) that Ansible uses may also read defaults for credentials and other settings, such as the region, from its configuration files in the Ansible ‘host’ context (typically `~/.aws/credentials`). See <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html> for more information.
