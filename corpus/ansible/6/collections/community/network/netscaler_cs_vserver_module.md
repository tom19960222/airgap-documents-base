| **authenticationhost**  string | FQDN of the authentication virtual server. The service type of the virtual server should be either `HTTP` or `SSL`.  Minimum length = 3  Maximum length = 252 |
| **authn401**  boolean | Enable HTTP 401-response based authentication.  Choices:   - `false` - `true` |
| **authnprofile**  string | Name of the authentication profile to be used when authentication is turned on. |
| **authnvsname**  string | Name of authentication virtual server that authenticates the incoming user requests to this content switching virtual server. .  Minimum length = 1  Maximum length = 252 |
| **backupip**  string | .  Minimum length = 1 |
| **backupvserver**  string | Name of the backup virtual server that you are configuring. Must begin with an ASCII alphanumeric or underscore `_` character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore `_`, hash `#`, period `.`, space , colon `:`, at sign `@`, equal sign `=`, and hyphen `-` characters. Can be changed after the backup virtual server is created. You can assign a different backup virtual server or rename the existing virtual server.  Minimum length = 1 |
| **cacheable**  boolean | Use this option to specify whether a virtual server, used for load balancing or content switching, routes requests to the cache redirection virtual server before sending it to the configured servers.  Choices:   - `false` - `true` |
| **casesensitive**  boolean | Consider case in URLs (for policies that use URLs instead of RULES). For example, with the `on` setting, the URLs /a/1.html and /A/1.HTML are treated differently and can have different targets (set by content switching policies). With the `off` setting, /a/1.html and /A/1.HTML are switched to the same target.  Choices:   - `false` - `true` |
| **clttimeout**  string | Idle time, in seconds, after which the client connection is terminated. The default values are:  Minimum value = `0`  Maximum value = `31536000` |
| **comment**  string | Information about this virtual server. |
| **cookiedomain**  string | .  Minimum length = 1 |
| **cookietimeout**  string | .  Minimum value = `0`  Maximum value = `1440` |
| **dbprofilename**  string | Name of the DB profile.  Minimum length = 1  Maximum length = 127 |
| **disabled**  boolean | When set to `yes` the cs vserver will be disabled.  When set to `no` the cs vserver will be enabled.  Note that due to limitations of the underlying NITRO API a `disabled` state change alone does not cause the module result to report a changed status.  Choices:   - `false` ← (default) - `true` |
| **disableprimaryondown**  string | Continue forwarding the traffic to backup virtual server even after the primary server comes UP from the DOWN state.  Choices:   - `"enabled"` - `"disabled"` |
| **dnsprofilename**  string | Name of the DNS profile to be associated with the VServer. DNS profile properties will applied to the transactions processed by a VServer. This parameter is valid only for DNS and DNS-TCP VServers.  Minimum length = 1  Maximum length = 127 |
| **domainname**  string | Domain name for which to change the time to live (TTL) and/or backup service IP address.  Minimum length = 1 |
| **downstateflush**  string | Flush all active transactions associated with a virtual server whose state transitions from UP to DOWN. Do not enable this option for applications that must complete their transactions.  Choices:   - `"enabled"` - `"disabled"` |
| **httpprofilename**  string | Name of the HTTP profile containing HTTP configuration settings for the virtual server. The service type of the virtual server should be either `HTTP` or `SSL`.  Minimum length = 1  Maximum length = 127 |
| **icmpvsrresponse**  string | Can be active or passive.  Choices:   - `"PASSIVE"` - `"ACTIVE"` |
| **insertvserveripport**  string | Insert the virtual server’s VIP address and port number in the request header. Available values function as follows:  `VIPADDR` - Header contains the vserver’s IP address and port number without any translation.  `OFF` - The virtual IP and port header insertion option is disabled.  `V6TOV4MAPPING` - Header contains the mapped IPv4 address corresponding to the IPv6 address of the vserver and the port number. An IPv6 address can be mapped to a user-specified IPv4 address using the set ns ip6 command.  Choices:   - `"OFF"` - `"VIPADDR"` - `"V6TOV4MAPPING"` |
| **ipmask**  string | IP mask, in dotted decimal notation, for the IP Pattern parameter. Can have leading or trailing non-zero octets (for example, `255.255.240.0` or `0.0.255.255`). Accordingly, the mask specifies whether the first n bits or the last n bits of the destination IP address in a client request are to be matched with the corresponding bits in the IP pattern. The former is called a forward mask. The latter is called a reverse mask. |
| **ippattern**  string | IP address pattern, in dotted decimal notation, for identifying packets to be accepted by the virtual server. The IP Mask parameter specifies which part of the destination IP address is matched against the pattern. Mutually exclusive with the IP Address parameter.  For example, if the IP pattern assigned to the virtual server is `198.51.100.0` and the IP mask is `255.255.240.0` (a forward mask), the first 20 bits in the destination IP addresses are matched with the first 20 bits in the pattern. The virtual server accepts requests with IP addresses that range from 198.51.96.1 to 198.51.111.254. You can also use a pattern such as `0.0.2.2` and a mask such as `0.0.255.255` (a reverse mask).  If a destination IP address matches more than one IP pattern, the pattern with the longest match is selected, and the associated virtual server processes the request. For example, if the virtual servers, `vs1` and `vs2`, have the same IP pattern, `0.0.100.128`, but different IP masks of `0.0.255.255` and `0.0.224.255`, a destination IP address of 198.51.100.128 has the longest match with the IP pattern of `vs1`. If a destination IP address matches two or more virtual servers to the same extent, the request is processed by the virtual server whose port number matches the port number in the request. |
