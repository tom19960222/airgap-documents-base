## [Synopsis](na_ontap_fdss_module.md#id1)

- Set file directory security information.
- This module is not idempotent. If re-running this module to apply the currently assigned policy, the policy will be reassigned.

## [Parameters](na_ontap_fdss_module.md#id3)

| Parameter | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| **cert_filepath**  string  added in netapp.ontap 20.6.0 | path to SSL client cert file (.pem).  not supported with python 2.6. |
| **feature_flags**  dictionary  added in netapp.ontap 20.5.0 | Enable or disable a new feature.  This can be used to enable an experimental feature or disable a new feature that breaks backward compatibility.  Supported keys and values are subject to change without notice. Unknown keys are ignored. |
| **force_ontap_version**  string  added in netapp.ontap 21.23.0 | Override the cluster ONTAP version when using REST.  The behavior is undefined if the version does not match the target cluster.  This is provided as a work-around when the cluster version cannot be read because of permission issues. See <https://github.com/ansible-collections/netapp.ontap/wiki/Known-issues>.  This should be in the form 9.10 or 9.10.1 with each element being an integer number.  When `use_rest` is set to auto, this may force a switch to ZAPI based on the version and platform capabilities.  Ignored with ZAPI. |
| **hostname**  string / required | The hostname or IP address of the ONTAP instance. |
| **http_port**  integer | Override the default port (80 or 443) with this port |
| **https**  boolean | Enable and disable https.  Ignored when using REST as only https is supported.  Ignored when using SSL certificate authentication as it requires SSL.  Choices:   - `false` ← (default) - `true` |
| **key_filepath**  string  added in netapp.ontap 20.6.0 | path to SSL client key file. |
| **name**  string / required | Specifies the security policy to apply. |
| **ontapi**  integer | The ontap api version to use |
| **password**  aliases: pass  string | Password for the specified user. |
| **state**  string | Whether the specified Policy Task should exist or not.  Choices:   - `"present"` ← (default) |
| **use_rest**  string | Whether to use REST or ZAPI.  always – will always use the REST API if the module supports REST. A warning is issued if the module does not support REST. An error is issued if a module option is not supported in REST.  never – will always use ZAPI if the module supports ZAPI. An error may be issued if a REST option is not supported in ZAPI.  auto – will try to use the REST API if the module supports REST and modules options are supported. Reverts to ZAPI otherwise.  Default: `"auto"` |
| **username**  aliases: user  string | This can be a Cluster-scoped or SVM-scoped account, depending on whether a Cluster-level or SVM-level API is required.  For more information, please read the documentation <https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/nmsdk/9.4/>.  Two authentication methods are supported   1. basic authentication, using username and password, 2. SSL certificate authentication, using a ssl client cert file, and optionally a private key file.   To use a certificate, the certificate must have been installed in the ONTAP cluster, and cert authentication must have been enabled. |
| **validate_certs**  boolean | If set to `no`, the SSL certificates will not be validated.  This should only set to `False` used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.  Choices:   - `false` - `true` ← (default) |
| **vserver**  string / required | Specifies the Vserver that contains the path to which the security policy is applied. |

## [Notes](na_ontap_fdss_module.md#id4)

> **Note:**
>
> - The modules prefixed with na_ontap are built to support the ONTAP storage platform.
> - https is enabled by default and recommended. To enable http on the cluster you must run the following commands ‘set -privilege advanced;’ ‘system services web modify -http-enabled true;’

## [Examples](na_ontap_fdss_module.md#id5)

```yaml+jinja
