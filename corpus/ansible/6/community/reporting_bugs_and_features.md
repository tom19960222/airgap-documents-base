# Reporting bugs and requesting features

- [Requesting a feature](reporting_bugs_and_features.md#requesting-a-feature)

## [Reporting a bug](reporting_bugs_and_features.md#id1)

### [Security bugs](reporting_bugs_and_features.md#id2)

Ansible practices responsible disclosure. To report security-related bugs, send an email to [security@ansible.com](mailto:security%40ansible.com) for an immediate response. Do not submit a ticket or post to any public groups.

### [Bugs in ansible-core](reporting_bugs_and_features.md#id3)

Before reporting a bug, search in GitHub for [already reported issues](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues) and [open pull requests](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pulls) to see if someone has already addressed your issue. Unsure if you found a bug? Report the behavior on the [mailing list or community chat first](communication.md#communication).

Also, use the mailing list or chat to discuss whether the problem is in `ansible-core` or a collection, and for “how do I do this” type questions.

You need a free GitHub account to [report bugs](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues) that affect:

- multiple plugins
- a plugin that remained in the ansible/ansible repo
- the overall functioning of Ansible

### [How to write a good bug report](reporting_bugs_and_features.md#id4)

If you find a bug, open an issue using the [issue template](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.yml).

Fill out the issue template as completely and as accurately as possible. Include:

- your Ansible version
- the expected behavior and what you’ve tried, including the exact commands you were using or tasks you are running.
- the current behavior and why you think it is a bug
- the steps to reproduce the bug
- a minimal reproducible example and comments describing examples
- any relevant configurations and the components you used
- any relevant output plus `ansible -vvvv` (debugging) output
- add the output of `ansible-test-env --show` when filing bug reports involving `ansible-test`.

When sharing YAML in playbooks, ensure that you preserve formatting using [code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/). For multiple-file content, use gist.github.com, more durable than Pastebin content.

## [Requesting a feature](reporting_bugs_and_features.md#id5)

Before you request a feature, check what is [planned for future Ansible Releases](../roadmap/ansible_roadmap_index.md#roadmaps). Check [existing pull requests tagged with feature](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afeature).

To get your feature into Ansible, [submit a pull request](development_process.md#community-pull-requests), either against ansible-core or a collection. See also [Requirements to merge your PR](contributing_maintained_collections.md#ansible-collection-merge-requirements). For `ansible-core`, you can also open an issue in [ansible/ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues) or in a corresponding collection repository (To find the correct issue tracker, refer to [Bugs in collections](reporting_collections.md#reporting-bugs-in-collections) ).
