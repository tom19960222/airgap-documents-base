# `tokenize` — Tokenizer for Python source

**Source code:** [Lib/tokenize.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.10/Lib/tokenize.py)

---

The [`tokenize`](tokenize.md#module-tokenize "tokenize: Lexical scanner for Python source code.") module provides a lexical scanner for Python source code,
implemented in Python. The scanner in this module returns comments as tokens
as well, making it useful for implementing “pretty-printers”, including
colorizers for on-screen displays.

To simplify token stream handling, all [operator](https://docs.python.org/3.10/reference/lexical_analysis.html#operators) and
[delimiter](https://docs.python.org/3.10/reference/lexical_analysis.html#delimiters) tokens and [`Ellipsis`](constants.md#Ellipsis "Ellipsis") are returned using
the generic [`OP`](token.md#token.OP "token.OP") token type. The exact
type can be determined by checking the `exact_type` property on the
[named tuple](https://docs.python.org/3.10/glossary.html#term-named-tuple) returned from [`tokenize.tokenize()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.tokenize "tokenize.tokenize").

> **Warning:**
>
> Note that the functions in this module are only designed to parse
> syntactically valid Python code (code that does not raise when parsed
> using [`ast.parse()`](ast.md#ast.parse "ast.parse")). The behavior of the functions in this module is
> **undefined** when providing invalid Python code and it can change at any
> point.

## Tokenizing Input

The primary entry point is a [generator](https://docs.python.org/3.10/glossary.html#term-generator):

`tokenize.tokenize(readline)`
:   The [`tokenize()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.tokenize "tokenize.tokenize") generator requires one argument, *readline*, which
    must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the
    [`io.IOBase.readline()`](io.md#io.IOBase.readline "io.IOBase.readline") method of file objects. Each call to the
    function should return one line of input as bytes.

    The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the
    token string; a 2-tuple `(srow, scol)` of ints specifying the row and
    column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple `(erow, ecol)` of
    ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source; and
    the line on which the token was found. The line passed (the last tuple item)
    is the *physical* line. The 5 tuple is returned as a [named tuple](https://docs.python.org/3.10/glossary.html#term-named-tuple)
    with the field names:
    `type string start end line`.

    The returned [named tuple](https://docs.python.org/3.10/glossary.html#term-named-tuple) has an additional property named
    `exact_type` that contains the exact operator type for
    [`OP`](token.md#token.OP "token.OP") tokens. For all other token types `exact_type`
    equals the named tuple `type` field.

    Changed in version 3.1: Added support for named tuples.

    Changed in version 3.3: Added support for `exact_type`.

    [`tokenize()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.tokenize "tokenize.tokenize") determines the source encoding of the file by looking for a
    UTF-8 BOM or encoding cookie, according to [**PEP 263**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263).

`tokenize.generate_tokens(readline)`
:   Tokenize a source reading unicode strings instead of bytes.

    Like [`tokenize()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.tokenize "tokenize.tokenize"), the *readline* argument is a callable returning
    a single line of input. However, [`generate_tokens()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.generate_tokens "tokenize.generate_tokens") expects *readline*
    to return a str object rather than bytes.

    The result is an iterator yielding named tuples, exactly like
    [`tokenize()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.tokenize "tokenize.tokenize"). It does not yield an [`ENCODING`](token.md#token.ENCODING "token.ENCODING") token.

All constants from the [`token`](token.md#module-token "token: Constants representing terminal nodes of the parse tree.") module are also exported from
[`tokenize`](tokenize.md#module-tokenize "tokenize: Lexical scanner for Python source code.").

Another function is provided to reverse the tokenization process. This is
useful for creating tools that tokenize a script, modify the token stream, and
write back the modified script.

`tokenize.untokenize(iterable)`
:   Converts tokens back into Python source code. The *iterable* must return
    sequences with at least two elements, the token type and the token string.
    Any additional sequence elements are ignored.

    The reconstructed script is returned as a single string. The result is
    guaranteed to tokenize back to match the input so that the conversion is
    lossless and round-trips are assured. The guarantee applies only to the
    token type and token string as the spacing between tokens (column
    positions) may change.

    It returns bytes, encoded using the [`ENCODING`](token.md#token.ENCODING "token.ENCODING") token, which
    is the first token sequence output by [`tokenize()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.tokenize "tokenize.tokenize"). If there is no
    encoding token in the input, it returns a str instead.

[`tokenize()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.tokenize "tokenize.tokenize") needs to detect the encoding of source files it tokenizes. The
function it uses to do this is available:

`tokenize.detect_encoding(readline)`
:   The [`detect_encoding()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.detect_encoding "tokenize.detect_encoding") function is used to detect the encoding that
    should be used to decode a Python source file. It requires one argument,
    readline, in the same way as the [`tokenize()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.tokenize "tokenize.tokenize") generator.

    It will call readline a maximum of twice, and return the encoding used
    (as a string) and a list of any lines (not decoded from bytes) it has read
    in.

    It detects the encoding from the presence of a UTF-8 BOM or an encoding
    cookie as specified in [**PEP 263**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263). If both a BOM and a cookie are present,
    but disagree, a [`SyntaxError`](exceptions.md#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") will be raised. Note that if the BOM is found,
    `'utf-8-sig'` will be returned as an encoding.

    If no encoding is specified, then the default of `'utf-8'` will be
    returned.

    Use [`open()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.open "tokenize.open") to open Python source files: it uses
    [`detect_encoding()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.detect_encoding "tokenize.detect_encoding") to detect the file encoding.

`tokenize.open(filename)`
:   Open a file in read only mode using the encoding detected by
    [`detect_encoding()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.detect_encoding "tokenize.detect_encoding").

    New in version 3.2.

`exception tokenize.TokenError`
:   Raised when either a docstring or expression that may be split over several
    lines is not completed anywhere in the file, for example:

    ```python3
    """Beginning of
    docstring
    ```

    or:

    ```python3
    [1,
     2,
     3
    ```

Note that unclosed single-quoted strings do not cause an error to be
raised. They are tokenized as [`ERRORTOKEN`](token.md#token.ERRORTOKEN "token.ERRORTOKEN"), followed by the
tokenization of their contents.

## Command-Line Usage

New in version 3.3.

The [`tokenize`](tokenize.md#module-tokenize "tokenize: Lexical scanner for Python source code.") module can be executed as a script from the command line.
It is as simple as:

```sh
python -m tokenize [-e] [filename.py]
```

The following options are accepted:

`-h, --help`
:   show this help message and exit

`-e, --exact`
:   display token names using the exact type

If `filename.py` is specified its contents are tokenized to stdout.
Otherwise, tokenization is performed on stdin.

## Examples

Example of a script rewriter that transforms float literals into Decimal
objects:

```python3
from tokenize import tokenize, untokenize, NUMBER, STRING, NAME, OP
from io import BytesIO

def decistmt(s):
    """Substitute Decimals for floats in a string of statements.

    >>> from decimal import Decimal
    >>> s = 'print(+21.3e-5*-.1234/81.7)'
    >>> decistmt(s)
    "print (+Decimal ('21.3e-5')*-Decimal ('.1234')/Decimal ('81.7'))"

    The format of the exponent is inherited from the platform C library.
    Known cases are "e-007" (Windows) and "e-07" (not Windows).  Since
    we're only showing 12 digits, and the 13th isn't close to 5, the
    rest of the output should be platform-independent.

    >>> exec(s)  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    -3.21716034272e-0...7

    Output from calculations with Decimal should be identical across all
    platforms.

    >>> exec(decistmt(s))
    -3.217160342717258261933904529E-7
    """
    result = []
    g = tokenize(BytesIO(s.encode('utf-8')).readline)  # tokenize the string
    for toknum, tokval, _, _, _ in g:
        if toknum == NUMBER and '.' in tokval:  # replace NUMBER tokens
            result.extend([
                (NAME, 'Decimal'),
                (OP, '('),
                (STRING, repr(tokval)),
                (OP, ')')
            ])
        else:
            result.append((toknum, tokval))
    return untokenize(result).decode('utf-8')
```

Example of tokenizing from the command line. The script:

```python3
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, World!")

say_hello()
```

will be tokenized to the following output where the first column is the range
of the line/column coordinates where the token is found, the second column is
the name of the token, and the final column is the value of the token (if any)

```shell-session
$ python -m tokenize hello.py
0,0-0,0:            ENCODING       'utf-8'
1,0-1,3:            NAME           'def'
1,4-1,13:           NAME           'say_hello'
1,13-1,14:          OP             '('
1,14-1,15:          OP             ')'
1,15-1,16:          OP             ':'
1,16-1,17:          NEWLINE        '\n'
2,0-2,4:            INDENT         '    '

2,10-2,25:          STRING         '"Hello, World!"'
2,25-2,26:          OP             ')'
2,26-2,27:          NEWLINE        '\n'
3,0-3,1:            NL             '\n'
4,0-4,0:            DEDENT         ''
4,0-4,9:            NAME           'say_hello'
4,9-4,10:           OP             '('
4,10-4,11:          OP             ')'
4,11-4,12:          NEWLINE        '\n'
5,0-5,0:            ENDMARKER      ''
```

The exact token type names can be displayed using the [`-e`](tokenize.md#cmdoption-tokenize-e) option:

```shell-session
$ python -m tokenize -e hello.py
0,0-0,0:            ENCODING       'utf-8'
1,0-1,3:            NAME           'def'
1,4-1,13:           NAME           'say_hello'
1,13-1,14:          LPAR           '('
1,14-1,15:          RPAR           ')'
1,15-1,16:          COLON          ':'
1,16-1,17:          NEWLINE        '\n'
2,0-2,4:            INDENT         '    '
2,4-2,9:            NAME           'print'
2,9-2,10:           LPAR           '('
2,10-2,25:          STRING         '"Hello, World!"'
2,25-2,26:          RPAR           ')'
2,26-2,27:          NEWLINE        '\n'
3,0-3,1:            NL             '\n'
4,0-4,0:            DEDENT         ''
4,0-4,9:            NAME           'say_hello'
4,9-4,10:           LPAR           '('
4,10-4,11:          RPAR           ')'
4,11-4,12:          NEWLINE        '\n'
5,0-5,0:            ENDMARKER      ''
```

Example of tokenizing a file programmatically, reading unicode
strings instead of bytes with [`generate_tokens()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.generate_tokens "tokenize.generate_tokens"):

```python3
import tokenize

with tokenize.open('hello.py') as f:
    tokens = tokenize.generate_tokens(f.readline)
    for token in tokens:
        print(token)
```

Or reading bytes directly with [`tokenize()`](tokenize.md#tokenize.tokenize "tokenize.tokenize"):

```python3
import tokenize

with open('hello.py', 'rb') as f:
    tokens = tokenize.tokenize(f.readline)
    for token in tokens:
        print(token)
```
