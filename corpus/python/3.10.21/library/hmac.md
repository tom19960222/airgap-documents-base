# `hmac` — Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication

**Source code:** [Lib/hmac.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.10/Lib/hmac.py)

---

This module implements the HMAC algorithm as described by [**RFC 2104**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2104.html).

`hmac.new(key, msg=None, digestmod='')`
:   Return a new hmac object. *key* is a bytes or bytearray object giving the
    secret key. If *msg* is present, the method call `update(msg)` is made.
    *digestmod* is the digest name, digest constructor or module for the HMAC
    object to use. It may be any name suitable to [`hashlib.new()`](hashlib.md#hashlib.new "hashlib.new").
    Despite its argument position, it is required.

    Changed in version 3.4: Parameter *key* can be a bytes or bytearray object.
    Parameter *msg* can be of any type supported by [`hashlib`](hashlib.md#module-hashlib "hashlib: Secure hash and message digest algorithms.").
    Parameter *digestmod* can be the name of a hash algorithm.

    Deprecated since version 3.4, removed in version 3.8: MD5 as implicit default digest for *digestmod* is deprecated.
    The digestmod parameter is now required. Pass it as a keyword
    argument to avoid awkwardness when you do not have an initial msg.

`hmac.digest(key, msg, digest)`
:   Return digest of *msg* for given secret *key* and *digest*. The
    function is equivalent to `HMAC(key, msg, digest).digest()`, but
    uses an optimized C or inline implementation, which is faster for messages
    that fit into memory. The parameters *key*, *msg*, and *digest* have
    the same meaning as in [`new()`](hmac.md#hmac.new "hmac.new").

    CPython implementation detail, the optimized C implementation is only used
    when *digest* is a string and name of a digest algorithm, which is
    supported by OpenSSL.

    New in version 3.7.

An HMAC object has the following methods:

`HMAC.update(msg)`
:   Update the hmac object with *msg*. Repeated calls are equivalent to a
    single call with the concatenation of all the arguments:
    `m.update(a); m.update(b)` is equivalent to `m.update(a + b)`.

    Changed in version 3.4: Parameter *msg* can be of any type supported by [`hashlib`](hashlib.md#module-hashlib "hashlib: Secure hash and message digest algorithms.").

`HMAC.digest()`
:   Return the digest of the bytes passed to the [`update()`](hmac.md#hmac.HMAC.update "hmac.HMAC.update") method so far.
    This bytes object will be the same length as the *digest_size* of the digest
    given to the constructor. It may contain non-ASCII bytes, including NUL
    bytes.

    > **Warning:**
    >
    > When comparing the output of [`digest()`](hmac.md#hmac.digest "hmac.digest") to an externally supplied
    > digest during a verification routine, it is recommended to use the
    > [`compare_digest()`](hmac.md#hmac.compare_digest "hmac.compare_digest") function instead of the `==` operator
    > to reduce the vulnerability to timing attacks.

`HMAC.hexdigest()`
:   Like [`digest()`](hmac.md#hmac.digest "hmac.digest") except the digest is returned as a string twice the
    length containing only hexadecimal digits. This may be used to exchange the
    value safely in email or other non-binary environments.

    > When comparing the output of [`hexdigest()`](hmac.md#hmac.HMAC.hexdigest "hmac.HMAC.hexdigest") to an externally supplied

    > to reduce the vulnerability to timing attacks.

`HMAC.copy()`
:   Return a copy (“clone”) of the hmac object. This can be used to efficiently
    compute the digests of strings that share a common initial substring.

A hash object has the following attributes:

`HMAC.digest_size`
:   The size of the resulting HMAC digest in bytes.

`HMAC.block_size`
:   The internal block size of the hash algorithm in bytes.

    New in version 3.4.

`HMAC.name`
:   The canonical name of this HMAC, always lowercase, e.g. `hmac-md5`.

    New in version 3.4.

Deprecated since version 3.9: The undocumented attributes `HMAC.digest_cons`, `HMAC.inner`, and
`HMAC.outer` are internal implementation details and will be removed in
Python 3.10.

This module also provides the following helper function:

`hmac.compare_digest(a, b)`
:   Return `a == b`. This function uses an approach designed to prevent
    timing analysis by avoiding content-based short circuiting behaviour,
    making it appropriate for cryptography. *a* and *b* must both be of the
    same type: either [`str`](stdtypes.md#str "str") (ASCII only, as e.g. returned by
    [`HMAC.hexdigest()`](hmac.md#hmac.HMAC.hexdigest "hmac.HMAC.hexdigest")), or a [bytes-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.10/glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object).

    > **Note:**
    >
    > If *a* and *b* are of different lengths, or if an error occurs,
    > a timing attack could theoretically reveal information about the
    > types and lengths of *a* and *b*—but not their values.

    New in version 3.3.

    Changed in version 3.10: The function uses OpenSSL’s `CRYPTO_memcmp()` internally when
    available.
