# `threading` — Thread-based parallelism

**Source code:** [Lib/threading.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.10/Lib/threading.py)

---

This module constructs higher-level threading interfaces on top of the lower
level [`_thread`](_thread.md#module-_thread "_thread: Low-level threading API.") module.

Changed in version 3.7: This module used to be optional, it is now always available.

>
> [`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`](concurrent.futures.md#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor") offers a higher level interface

**CPython implementation detail:** In CPython, due to the [Global Interpreter Lock](https://docs.python.org/3.10/glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock), only one thread
can execute Python code at once (even though certain performance-oriented
libraries might overcome this limitation).
If you want your application to make better use of the computational
resources of multi-core machines, you are advised to use
[`multiprocessing`](multiprocessing.md#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism.") or [`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`](concurrent.futures.md#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor").
However, threading is still an appropriate model if you want to run
multiple I/O-bound tasks simultaneously.

This module defines the following functions:

`threading.active_count()`
:   Return the number of [`Thread`](threading.md#threading.Thread "threading.Thread") objects currently alive. The returned
    count is equal to the length of the list returned by [`enumerate()`](threading.md#threading.enumerate "threading.enumerate").

    The function `activeCount` is a deprecated alias for this function.

`threading.current_thread()`
:   Return the current [`Thread`](threading.md#threading.Thread "threading.Thread") object, corresponding to the caller’s thread
    of control. If the caller’s thread of control was not created through the
    [`threading`](threading.md#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.") module, a dummy thread object with limited functionality is
    returned.

    The function `currentThread` is a deprecated alias for this function.

`threading.excepthook(args, /)`
:   Handle uncaught exception raised by [`Thread.run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run "threading.Thread.run").

    The *args* argument has the following attributes:

    - *exc_type*: Exception type.
    - *exc_value*: Exception value, can be `None`.
    - *exc_traceback*: Exception traceback, can be `None`.
    - *thread*: Thread which raised the exception, can be `None`.

    If *exc_type* is [`SystemExit`](exceptions.md#SystemExit "SystemExit"), the exception is silently ignored.
    Otherwise, the exception is printed out on [`sys.stderr`](sys.md#sys.stderr "sys.stderr").

    If this function raises an exception, [`sys.excepthook()`](sys.md#sys.excepthook "sys.excepthook") is called to
    handle it.

    [`threading.excepthook()`](threading.md#threading.excepthook "threading.excepthook") can be overridden to control how uncaught
    exceptions raised by [`Thread.run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run "threading.Thread.run") are handled.

    Storing *exc_value* using a custom hook can create a reference cycle. It
    should be cleared explicitly to break the reference cycle when the
    exception is no longer needed.

    Storing *thread* using a custom hook can resurrect it if it is set to an
    object which is being finalized. Avoid storing *thread* after the custom
    hook completes to avoid resurrecting objects.

    > **See also:**
    >
    > [`sys.excepthook()`](sys.md#sys.excepthook "sys.excepthook") handles uncaught exceptions.

    New in version 3.8.

`threading.__excepthook__`
:   Holds the original value of [`threading.excepthook()`](threading.md#threading.excepthook "threading.excepthook"). It is saved so that the
    original value can be restored in case they happen to get replaced with
    broken or alternative objects.

    New in version 3.10.

`threading.get_ident()`
:   Return the ‘thread identifier’ of the current thread. This is a nonzero
    integer. Its value has no direct meaning; it is intended as a magic cookie
    to be used e.g. to index a dictionary of thread-specific data. Thread
    identifiers may be recycled when a thread exits and another thread is
    created.

    New in version 3.3.

`threading.get_native_id()`
:   Return the native integral Thread ID of the current thread assigned by the kernel.
    This is a non-negative integer.
    Its value may be used to uniquely identify this particular thread system-wide
    (until the thread terminates, after which the value may be recycled by the OS).

    [Availability](intro.md#availability): Windows, FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, OpenBSD, NetBSD, AIX.

    New in version 3.8.

`threading.enumerate()`
:   Return a list of all [`Thread`](threading.md#threading.Thread "threading.Thread") objects currently active. The list
    includes daemonic threads and dummy thread objects created by
    [`current_thread()`](threading.md#threading.current_thread "threading.current_thread"). It excludes terminated threads and threads
    that have not yet been started. However, the main thread is always part
    of the result, even when terminated.

`threading.main_thread()`
:   Return the main [`Thread`](threading.md#threading.Thread "threading.Thread") object. In normal conditions, the
    main thread is the thread from which the Python interpreter was
    started.

    New in version 3.4.

`threading.settrace(func)`
:   Set a trace function for all threads started from the [`threading`](threading.md#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.") module.
    The *func* will be passed to [`sys.settrace()`](sys.md#sys.settrace "sys.settrace") for each thread, before its
    [`run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run "threading.Thread.run") method is called.

`threading.gettrace()`
:   Get the trace function as set by [`settrace()`](threading.md#threading.settrace "threading.settrace").

    New in version 3.10.

`threading.setprofile(func)`
:   Set a profile function for all threads started from the [`threading`](threading.md#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.") module.
    The *func* will be passed to [`sys.setprofile()`](sys.md#sys.setprofile "sys.setprofile") for each thread, before its
    [`run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run "threading.Thread.run") method is called.

`threading.getprofile()`
:   Get the profiler function as set by [`setprofile()`](threading.md#threading.setprofile "threading.setprofile").

    New in version 3.10.

`threading.stack_size([size])`
:   Return the thread stack size used when creating new threads. The optional
    *size* argument specifies the stack size to be used for subsequently created
    threads, and must be 0 (use platform or configured default) or a positive
    integer value of at least 32,768 (32 KiB). If *size* is not specified,
    0 is used. If changing the thread stack size is
    unsupported, a [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") is raised. If the specified stack size is
    invalid, a [`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError "ValueError") is raised and the stack size is unmodified. 32 KiB
    is currently the minimum supported stack size value to guarantee sufficient
    stack space for the interpreter itself. Note that some platforms may have
    particular restrictions on values for the stack size, such as requiring a
    minimum stack size > 32 KiB or requiring allocation in multiples of the system
    memory page size - platform documentation should be referred to for more
    information (4 KiB pages are common; using multiples of 4096 for the stack size is
    the suggested approach in the absence of more specific information).

    [Availability](intro.md#availability): Windows, systems with POSIX threads.

This module also defines the following constant:

`threading.TIMEOUT_MAX`
:   The maximum value allowed for the *timeout* parameter of blocking functions
    ([`Lock.acquire()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.acquire "threading.Lock.acquire"), [`RLock.acquire()`](threading.md#threading.RLock.acquire "threading.RLock.acquire"), [`Condition.wait()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.wait "threading.Condition.wait"), etc.).
    Specifying a timeout greater than this value will raise an
    [`OverflowError`](exceptions.md#OverflowError "OverflowError").

    New in version 3.2.

This module defines a number of classes, which are detailed in the sections
below.

The design of this module is loosely based on Java’s threading model. However,
where Java makes locks and condition variables basic behavior of every object,
they are separate objects in Python. Python’s [`Thread`](threading.md#threading.Thread "threading.Thread") class supports a
subset of the behavior of Java’s Thread class; currently, there are no
priorities, no thread groups, and threads cannot be destroyed, stopped,
suspended, resumed, or interrupted. The static methods of Java’s Thread class,
when implemented, are mapped to module-level functions.

All of the methods described below are executed atomically.

## Thread-Local Data

Thread-local data is data whose values are thread specific. To manage
thread-local data, just create an instance of [`local`](threading.md#threading.local "threading.local") (or a
subclass) and store attributes on it:

```python3
mydata = threading.local()
mydata.x = 1
```

The instance’s values will be different for separate threads.

`class threading.local`
:   A class that represents thread-local data.

    For more details and extensive examples, see the documentation string of the
    `_threading_local` module.

## Thread Objects

The [`Thread`](threading.md#threading.Thread "threading.Thread") class represents an activity that is run in a separate
thread of control. There are two ways to specify the activity: by passing a
callable object to the constructor, or by overriding the [`run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run "threading.Thread.run")
method in a subclass. No other methods (except for the constructor) should be
overridden in a subclass. In other words, *only* override the
`__init__()` and [`run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run "threading.Thread.run") methods of this class.

Once a thread object is created, its activity must be started by calling the
thread’s [`start()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.start "threading.Thread.start") method. This invokes the [`run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run "threading.Thread.run")
method in a separate thread of control.

Once the thread’s activity is started, the thread is considered ‘alive’. It
stops being alive when its [`run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run "threading.Thread.run") method terminates – either
normally, or by raising an unhandled exception. The [`is_alive()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.is_alive "threading.Thread.is_alive")
method tests whether the thread is alive.

Other threads can call a thread’s [`join()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.join "threading.Thread.join") method. This blocks
the calling thread until the thread whose [`join()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.join "threading.Thread.join") method is
called is terminated.

A thread has a name. The name can be passed to the constructor, and read or
changed through the [`name`](threading.md#threading.Thread.name "threading.Thread.name") attribute.

If the [`run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run "threading.Thread.run") method raises an exception,
[`threading.excepthook()`](threading.md#threading.excepthook "threading.excepthook") is called to handle it. By default,
[`threading.excepthook()`](threading.md#threading.excepthook "threading.excepthook") ignores silently [`SystemExit`](exceptions.md#SystemExit "SystemExit").

A thread can be flagged as a “daemon thread”. The significance of this flag is
that the entire Python program exits when only daemon threads are left. The
initial value is inherited from the creating thread. The flag can be set
through the [`daemon`](threading.md#threading.Thread.daemon "threading.Thread.daemon") property or the *daemon* constructor
argument.

> **Note:**
>
> Daemon threads are abruptly stopped at shutdown. Their resources (such
> as open files, database transactions, etc.) may not be released properly.
> If you want your threads to stop gracefully, make them non-daemonic and
> use a suitable signalling mechanism such as an [`Event`](threading.md#threading.Event "threading.Event").

There is a “main thread” object; this corresponds to the initial thread of
control in the Python program. It is not a daemon thread.

There is the possibility that “dummy thread objects” are created. These are
thread objects corresponding to “alien threads”, which are threads of control
started outside the threading module, such as directly from C code. Dummy
thread objects have limited functionality; they are always considered alive and
daemonic, and cannot be [`join()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.join "threading.Thread.join")ed. They are never deleted,
since it is impossible to detect the termination of alien threads.

`class threading.Thread(group=None, target=None, name=None, args=(), kwargs={}, *, daemon=None)`
:   This constructor should always be called with keyword arguments. Arguments
    are:

    *group* should be `None`; reserved for future extension when a
    `ThreadGroup` class is implemented.

    *target* is the callable object to be invoked by the [`run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run "threading.Thread.run") method.
    Defaults to `None`, meaning nothing is called.

    *name* is the thread name. By default, a unique name is constructed
    of the form “Thread-*N*” where *N* is a small decimal number,
    or “Thread-*N* (target)” where “target” is `target.__name__` if the
    *target* argument is specified.

    *args* is the argument tuple for the target invocation. Defaults to `()`.

    *kwargs* is a dictionary of keyword arguments for the target invocation.
    Defaults to `{}`.

    If not `None`, *daemon* explicitly sets whether the thread is daemonic.
    If `None` (the default), the daemonic property is inherited from the
    current thread.

    If the subclass overrides the constructor, it must make sure to invoke the
    base class constructor (`Thread.__init__()`) before doing anything else to
    the thread.

    Changed in version 3.10: Use the *target* name if *name* argument is omitted.

    Changed in version 3.3: Added the *daemon* argument.

    `start()`
    :   Start the thread’s activity.

        It must be called at most once per thread object. It arranges for the
        object’s [`run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run "threading.Thread.run") method to be invoked in a separate thread
        of control.

        This method will raise a [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") if called more than once
        on the same thread object.

    `run()`
    :   Method representing the thread’s activity.

        You may override this method in a subclass. The standard [`run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run "threading.Thread.run")
        method invokes the callable object passed to the object’s constructor as
        the *target* argument, if any, with positional and keyword arguments taken
        from the *args* and *kwargs* arguments, respectively.

    `join(timeout=None)`
    :   Wait until the thread terminates. This blocks the calling thread until
        the thread whose [`join()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.join "threading.Thread.join") method is called terminates – either
        normally or through an unhandled exception – or until the optional
        timeout occurs.

        When the *timeout* argument is present and not `None`, it should be a
        floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
        (or fractions thereof). As [`join()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.join "threading.Thread.join") always returns `None`,
        you must call [`is_alive()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.is_alive "threading.Thread.is_alive") after [`join()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.join "threading.Thread.join") to
        decide whether a timeout happened – if the thread is still alive, the
        [`join()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.join "threading.Thread.join") call timed out.

        When the *timeout* argument is not present or `None`, the operation will
        block until the thread terminates.

        A thread can be [`join()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.join "threading.Thread.join")ed many times.

        [`join()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.join "threading.Thread.join") raises a [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") if an attempt is made
        to join the current thread as that would cause a deadlock. It is also
        an error to [`join()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.join "threading.Thread.join") a thread before it has been started
        and attempts to do so raise the same exception.

    `name`
    :   A string used for identification purposes only. It has no semantics.
        Multiple threads may be given the same name. The initial name is set by
        the constructor.

    `getName()`

    `setName()`
    :   Deprecated getter/setter API for [`name`](threading.md#threading.Thread.name "threading.Thread.name"); use it directly as a
        property instead.

        Deprecated since version 3.10.

    `ident`
    :   The ‘thread identifier’ of this thread or `None` if the thread has not
        been started. This is a nonzero integer. See the [`get_ident()`](threading.md#threading.get_ident "threading.get_ident")
        function. Thread identifiers may be recycled when a thread exits and
        another thread is created. The identifier is available even after the
        thread has exited.

    `native_id`
    :   The Thread ID (`TID`) of this thread, as assigned by the OS (kernel).
        This is a non-negative integer, or `None` if the thread has not
        been started. See the [`get_native_id()`](threading.md#threading.get_native_id "threading.get_native_id") function.
        This value may be used to uniquely identify this particular thread
        system-wide (until the thread terminates, after which the value
        may be recycled by the OS).

        > **Note:**
        >
        > Similar to Process IDs, Thread IDs are only valid (guaranteed unique
        > system-wide) from the time the thread is created until the thread
        > has been terminated.

        [Availability](intro.md#availability): Requires [`get_native_id()`](threading.md#threading.get_native_id "threading.get_native_id") function.

        New in version 3.8.

    `is_alive()`
    :   Return whether the thread is alive.

        This method returns `True` just before the [`run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run "threading.Thread.run") method
        starts until just after the [`run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run "threading.Thread.run") method terminates. The
        module function [`enumerate()`](threading.md#threading.enumerate "threading.enumerate") returns a list of all alive threads.

    `daemon`
    :   A boolean value indicating whether this thread is a daemon thread (`True`)
        or not (`False`). This must be set before [`start()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.start "threading.Thread.start") is called,
        otherwise [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") is raised. Its initial value is inherited
        from the creating thread; the main thread is not a daemon thread and
        therefore all threads created in the main thread default to
        [`daemon`](threading.md#threading.Thread.daemon "threading.Thread.daemon") = `False`.

        The entire Python program exits when no alive non-daemon threads are left.

    `isDaemon()`

    `setDaemon()`
    :   Deprecated getter/setter API for [`daemon`](threading.md#threading.Thread.daemon "threading.Thread.daemon"); use it directly as a
        property instead.

        Deprecated since version 3.10.

## Lock Objects

A primitive lock is a synchronization primitive that is not owned by a
particular thread when locked. In Python, it is currently the lowest level
synchronization primitive available, implemented directly by the [`_thread`](_thread.md#module-_thread "_thread: Low-level threading API.")
extension module.

A primitive lock is in one of two states, “locked” or “unlocked”. It is created
in the unlocked state. It has two basic methods, [`acquire()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.acquire "threading.Lock.acquire") and
[`release()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.release "threading.Lock.release"). When the state is unlocked, [`acquire()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.acquire "threading.Lock.acquire")
changes the state to locked and returns immediately. When the state is locked,
[`acquire()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.acquire "threading.Lock.acquire") blocks until a call to [`release()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.release "threading.Lock.release") in another
thread changes it to unlocked, then the [`acquire()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.acquire "threading.Lock.acquire") call resets it
to locked and returns. The [`release()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.release "threading.Lock.release") method should only be
called in the locked state; it changes the state to unlocked and returns
immediately. If an attempt is made to release an unlocked lock, a
[`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") will be raised.

Locks also support the [context management protocol](threading.md#with-locks).

When more than one thread is blocked in [`acquire()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.acquire "threading.Lock.acquire") waiting for the
state to turn to unlocked, only one thread proceeds when a [`release()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.release "threading.Lock.release")
call resets the state to unlocked; which one of the waiting threads proceeds
is not defined, and may vary across implementations.

All methods are executed atomically.

`class threading.Lock`
:   The class implementing primitive lock objects. Once a thread has acquired a
    lock, subsequent attempts to acquire it block, until it is released; any
    thread may release it.

    Note that `Lock` is actually a factory function which returns an instance
    of the most efficient version of the concrete Lock class that is supported
    by the platform.

    `acquire(blocking=True, timeout=- 1)`
    :   Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.

        When invoked with the *blocking* argument set to `True` (the default),
        block until the lock is unlocked, then set it to locked and return `True`.

        When invoked with the *blocking* argument set to `False`, do not block.
        If a call with *blocking* set to `True` would block, return `False`
        immediately; otherwise, set the lock to locked and return `True`.

        When invoked with the floating-point *timeout* argument set to a positive
        value, block for at most the number of seconds specified by *timeout*
        and as long as the lock cannot be acquired. A *timeout* argument of `-1`
        specifies an unbounded wait. It is forbidden to specify a *timeout*
        when *blocking* is `False`.

        The return value is `True` if the lock is acquired successfully,
        `False` if not (for example if the *timeout* expired).

        Changed in version 3.2: The *timeout* parameter is new.

        Changed in version 3.2: Lock acquisition can now be interrupted by signals on POSIX if the
        underlying threading implementation supports it.

    `release()`
    :   Release a lock. This can be called from any thread, not only the thread
        which has acquired the lock.

        When the lock is locked, reset it to unlocked, and return. If any other threads
        are blocked waiting for the lock to become unlocked, allow exactly one of them
        to proceed.

        When invoked on an unlocked lock, a [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") is raised.

        There is no return value.

    `locked()`
    :   Return `True` if the lock is acquired.

## RLock Objects

A reentrant lock is a synchronization primitive that may be acquired multiple
times by the same thread. Internally, it uses the concepts of “owning thread”
and “recursion level” in addition to the locked/unlocked state used by primitive
locks. In the locked state, some thread owns the lock; in the unlocked state,
no thread owns it.

To lock the lock, a thread calls its [`acquire()`](threading.md#threading.RLock.acquire "threading.RLock.acquire") method; this
returns once the thread owns the lock. To unlock the lock, a thread calls
its [`release()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.release "threading.Lock.release") method. [`acquire()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.acquire "threading.Lock.acquire")/[`release()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.release "threading.Lock.release")
call pairs may be nested; only the final [`release()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.release "threading.Lock.release") (the
[`release()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.release "threading.Lock.release") of the outermost pair) resets the lock to unlocked and
allows another thread blocked in [`acquire()`](threading.md#threading.Lock.acquire "threading.Lock.acquire") to proceed.

Reentrant locks also support the [context management protocol](threading.md#with-locks).

`class threading.RLock`
:   This class implements reentrant lock objects. A reentrant lock must be
    released by the thread that acquired it. Once a thread has acquired a
    reentrant lock, the same thread may acquire it again without blocking; the
    thread must release it once for each time it has acquired it.

    Note that `RLock` is actually a factory function which returns an instance
    of the most efficient version of the concrete RLock class that is supported
    by the platform.

    `acquire(blocking=True, timeout=- 1)`
    :   Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.

        When invoked without arguments: if this thread already owns the lock, increment
        the recursion level by one, and return immediately. Otherwise, if another
        thread owns the lock, block until the lock is unlocked. Once the lock is
        unlocked (not owned by any thread), then grab ownership, set the recursion level
        to one, and return. If more than one thread is blocked waiting until the lock
        is unlocked, only one at a time will be able to grab ownership of the lock.
        There is no return value in this case.

        When invoked with the *blocking* argument set to `True`, do the same thing as when
        called without arguments, and return `True`.

        When invoked with the *blocking* argument set to `False`, do not block. If a call
        without an argument would block, return `False` immediately; otherwise, do the
        same thing as when called without arguments, and return `True`.

        When invoked with the floating-point *timeout* argument set to a positive
        value, block for at most the number of seconds specified by *timeout*
        and as long as the lock cannot be acquired. Return `True` if the lock has
        been acquired, `False` if the timeout has elapsed.

        Changed in version 3.2: The *timeout* parameter is new.

    `release()`
    :   Release a lock, decrementing the recursion level. If after the decrement it is
        zero, reset the lock to unlocked (not owned by any thread), and if any other
        threads are blocked waiting for the lock to become unlocked, allow exactly one
        of them to proceed. If after the decrement the recursion level is still
        nonzero, the lock remains locked and owned by the calling thread.

        Only call this method when the calling thread owns the lock. A
        [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") is raised if this method is called when the lock is
        unlocked.

        There is no return value.

## Condition Objects

A condition variable is always associated with some kind of lock; this can be
passed in or one will be created by default. Passing one in is useful when
several condition variables must share the same lock. The lock is part of
the condition object: you don’t have to track it separately.

A condition variable obeys the [context management protocol](threading.md#with-locks):
using the `with` statement acquires the associated lock for the duration of
the enclosed block. The [`acquire()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.acquire "threading.Condition.acquire") and
[`release()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.release "threading.Condition.release") methods also call the corresponding methods of
the associated lock.

Other methods must be called with the associated lock held. The
[`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.wait "threading.Condition.wait") method releases the lock, and then blocks until
another thread awakens it by calling [`notify()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify "threading.Condition.notify") or
[`notify_all()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify_all "threading.Condition.notify_all"). Once awakened, [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.wait "threading.Condition.wait")
re-acquires the lock and returns. It is also possible to specify a timeout.

The [`notify()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify "threading.Condition.notify") method wakes up one of the threads waiting for
the condition variable, if any are waiting. The [`notify_all()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify_all "threading.Condition.notify_all")
method wakes up all threads waiting for the condition variable.

Note: the [`notify()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify "threading.Condition.notify") and [`notify_all()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify_all "threading.Condition.notify_all") methods
don’t release the lock; this means that the thread or threads awakened will
not return from their [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.wait "threading.Condition.wait") call immediately, but only when
the thread that called [`notify()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify "threading.Condition.notify") or [`notify_all()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify_all "threading.Condition.notify_all")
finally relinquishes ownership of the lock.

The typical programming style using condition variables uses the lock to
synchronize access to some shared state; threads that are interested in a
particular change of state call [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.wait "threading.Condition.wait") repeatedly until they
see the desired state, while threads that modify the state call
[`notify()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify "threading.Condition.notify") or [`notify_all()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify_all "threading.Condition.notify_all") when they change
the state in such a way that it could possibly be a desired state for one
of the waiters. For example, the following code is a generic
producer-consumer situation with unlimited buffer capacity:

```python3
# Consume one item
with cv:
    while not an_item_is_available():
        cv.wait()
    get_an_available_item()

# Produce one item
with cv:
    make_an_item_available()
    cv.notify()
```

The `while` loop checking for the application’s condition is necessary
because [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.wait "threading.Condition.wait") can return after an arbitrary long time,
and the condition which prompted the [`notify()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify "threading.Condition.notify") call may
no longer hold true. This is inherent to multi-threaded programming. The
[`wait_for()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.wait_for "threading.Condition.wait_for") method can be used to automate the condition
checking, and eases the computation of timeouts:

```python3
# Consume an item
with cv:
    cv.wait_for(an_item_is_available)
    get_an_available_item()
```

To choose between [`notify()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify "threading.Condition.notify") and [`notify_all()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify_all "threading.Condition.notify_all"),
consider whether one state change can be interesting for only one or several
waiting threads. E.g. in a typical producer-consumer situation, adding one
item to the buffer only needs to wake up one consumer thread.

`class threading.Condition(lock=None)`
:   This class implements condition variable objects. A condition variable
    allows one or more threads to wait until they are notified by another thread.

    If the *lock* argument is given and not `None`, it must be a [`Lock`](threading.md#threading.Lock "threading.Lock")
    or [`RLock`](threading.md#threading.RLock "threading.RLock") object, and it is used as the underlying lock. Otherwise,
    a new [`RLock`](threading.md#threading.RLock "threading.RLock") object is created and used as the underlying lock.

    Changed in version 3.3: changed from a factory function to a class.

    `acquire(*args)`
    :   Acquire the underlying lock. This method calls the corresponding method on
        the underlying lock; the return value is whatever that method returns.

    `release()`
    :   Release the underlying lock. This method calls the corresponding method on
        the underlying lock; there is no return value.

    `wait(timeout=None)`
    :   Wait until notified or until a timeout occurs. If the calling thread has
        not acquired the lock when this method is called, a [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") is
        raised.

        This method releases the underlying lock, and then blocks until it is
        awakened by a [`notify()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify "threading.Condition.notify") or [`notify_all()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify_all "threading.Condition.notify_all") call for the same
        condition variable in another thread, or until the optional timeout
        occurs. Once awakened or timed out, it re-acquires the lock and returns.

        When the *timeout* argument is present and not `None`, it should be a
        floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
        (or fractions thereof).

        When the underlying lock is an [`RLock`](threading.md#threading.RLock "threading.RLock"), it is not released using
        its [`release()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.release "threading.Condition.release") method, since this may not actually unlock the lock
        when it was acquired multiple times recursively. Instead, an internal
        interface of the [`RLock`](threading.md#threading.RLock "threading.RLock") class is used, which really unlocks it
        even when it has been recursively acquired several times. Another internal
        interface is then used to restore the recursion level when the lock is
        reacquired.

        The return value is `True` unless a given *timeout* expired, in which
        case it is `False`.

        Changed in version 3.2: Previously, the method always returned `None`.

    `wait_for(predicate, timeout=None)`
    :   Wait until a condition evaluates to true. *predicate* should be a
        callable which result will be interpreted as a boolean value.
        A *timeout* may be provided giving the maximum time to wait.

        This utility method may call [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.wait "threading.Condition.wait") repeatedly until the predicate
        is satisfied, or until a timeout occurs. The return value is
        the last return value of the predicate and will evaluate to
        `False` if the method timed out.

        Ignoring the timeout feature, calling this method is roughly equivalent to
        writing:

        ```python3
        while not predicate():
            cv.wait()
        ```

        Therefore, the same rules apply as with [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.wait "threading.Condition.wait"): The lock must be
        held when called and is re-acquired on return. The predicate is evaluated
        with the lock held.

        New in version 3.2.

    `notify(n=1)`
    :   By default, wake up one thread waiting on this condition, if any. If the
        calling thread has not acquired the lock when this method is called, a
        [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") is raised.

        This method wakes up at most *n* of the threads waiting for the condition
        variable; it is a no-op if no threads are waiting.

        The current implementation wakes up exactly *n* threads, if at least *n*
        threads are waiting. However, it’s not safe to rely on this behavior.
        A future, optimized implementation may occasionally wake up more than
        *n* threads.

        Note: an awakened thread does not actually return from its [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.wait "threading.Condition.wait")
        call until it can reacquire the lock. Since [`notify()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify "threading.Condition.notify") does not
        release the lock, its caller should.

    `notify_all()`
    :   Wake up all threads waiting on this condition. This method acts like
        [`notify()`](threading.md#threading.Condition.notify "threading.Condition.notify"), but wakes up all waiting threads instead of one. If the
        calling thread has not acquired the lock when this method is called, a
        [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") is raised.

        The method `notifyAll` is a deprecated alias for this method.

## Semaphore Objects

This is one of the oldest synchronization primitives in the history of computer
science, invented by the early Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra (he
used the names `P()` and `V()` instead of [`acquire()`](threading.md#threading.Semaphore.acquire "threading.Semaphore.acquire") and
[`release()`](threading.md#threading.Semaphore.release "threading.Semaphore.release")).

A semaphore manages an internal counter which is decremented by each
[`acquire()`](threading.md#threading.Semaphore.acquire "threading.Semaphore.acquire") call and incremented by each [`release()`](threading.md#threading.Semaphore.release "threading.Semaphore.release")
call. The counter can never go below zero; when [`acquire()`](threading.md#threading.Semaphore.acquire "threading.Semaphore.acquire")
finds that it is zero, it blocks, waiting until some other thread calls
[`release()`](threading.md#threading.Semaphore.release "threading.Semaphore.release").

Semaphores also support the [context management protocol](threading.md#with-locks).

`class threading.Semaphore(value=1)`
:   This class implements semaphore objects. A semaphore manages an atomic
    counter representing the number of [`release()`](threading.md#threading.Semaphore.release "threading.Semaphore.release") calls minus the number of
    [`acquire()`](threading.md#threading.Semaphore.acquire "threading.Semaphore.acquire") calls, plus an initial value. The [`acquire()`](threading.md#threading.Semaphore.acquire "threading.Semaphore.acquire") method
    blocks if necessary until it can return without making the counter negative.
    If not given, *value* defaults to 1.

    The optional argument gives the initial *value* for the internal counter; it
    defaults to `1`. If the *value* given is less than 0, [`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError "ValueError") is
    raised.

    Changed in version 3.3: changed from a factory function to a class.

    `acquire(blocking=True, timeout=None)`
    :   Acquire a semaphore.

        When invoked without arguments:

        - If the internal counter is larger than zero on entry, decrement it by
          one and return `True` immediately.
        - If the internal counter is zero on entry, block until awoken by a call to
          [`release()`](threading.md#threading.Semaphore.release "threading.Semaphore.release"). Once awoken (and the counter is greater
          than 0), decrement the counter by 1 and return `True`. Exactly one
          thread will be awoken by each call to [`release()`](threading.md#threading.Semaphore.release "threading.Semaphore.release"). The
          order in which threads are awoken should not be relied on.

        When invoked with *blocking* set to `False`, do not block. If a call
        without an argument would block, return `False` immediately; otherwise, do
        the same thing as when called without arguments, and return `True`.

        When invoked with a *timeout* other than `None`, it will block for at
        most *timeout* seconds. If acquire does not complete successfully in
        that interval, return `False`. Return `True` otherwise.

        Changed in version 3.2: The *timeout* parameter is new.

    `release(n=1)`
    :   Release a semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by *n*. When it
        was zero on entry and other threads are waiting for it to become larger
        than zero again, wake up *n* of those threads.

        Changed in version 3.9: Added the *n* parameter to release multiple waiting threads at once.

`class threading.BoundedSemaphore(value=1)`
:   Class implementing bounded semaphore objects. A bounded semaphore checks to
    make sure its current value doesn’t exceed its initial value. If it does,
    [`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError "ValueError") is raised. In most situations semaphores are used to guard
    resources with limited capacity. If the semaphore is released too many times
    it’s a sign of a bug. If not given, *value* defaults to 1.

    Changed in version 3.3: changed from a factory function to a class.

### `Semaphore` Example

Semaphores are often used to guard resources with limited capacity, for example,
a database server. In any situation where the size of the resource is fixed,
you should use a bounded semaphore. Before spawning any worker threads, your
main thread would initialize the semaphore:

```python3
maxconnections = 5
# ...
pool_sema = BoundedSemaphore(value=maxconnections)
```

Once spawned, worker threads call the semaphore’s acquire and release methods
when they need to connect to the server:

```python3
with pool_sema:
    conn = connectdb()
    try:
        # ... use connection ...
    finally:
        conn.close()
```

The use of a bounded semaphore reduces the chance that a programming error which
causes the semaphore to be released more than it’s acquired will go undetected.

## Event Objects

This is one of the simplest mechanisms for communication between threads: one
thread signals an event and other threads wait for it.

An event object manages an internal flag that can be set to true with the
[`set()`](threading.md#threading.Event.set "threading.Event.set") method and reset to false with the [`clear()`](threading.md#threading.Event.clear "threading.Event.clear")
method. The [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Event.wait "threading.Event.wait") method blocks until the flag is true.

`class threading.Event`
:   Class implementing event objects. An event manages a flag that can be set to
    true with the [`set()`](threading.md#threading.Event.set "threading.Event.set") method and reset to false with the
    [`clear()`](threading.md#threading.Event.clear "threading.Event.clear") method. The [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Event.wait "threading.Event.wait") method blocks until the flag is true.
    The flag is initially false.

    Changed in version 3.3: changed from a factory function to a class.

    `is_set()`
    :   Return `True` if and only if the internal flag is true.

        The method `isSet` is a deprecated alias for this method.

    `set()`
    :   Set the internal flag to true. All threads waiting for it to become true
        are awakened. Threads that call [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Event.wait "threading.Event.wait") once the flag is true will
        not block at all.

    `clear()`
    :   Reset the internal flag to false. Subsequently, threads calling
        [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Event.wait "threading.Event.wait") will block until [`set()`](threading.md#threading.Event.set "threading.Event.set") is called to set the internal
        flag to true again.

    `wait(timeout=None)`
    :   Block until the internal flag is true. If the internal flag is true on
        entry, return immediately. Otherwise, block until another thread calls
        [`set()`](threading.md#threading.Event.set "threading.Event.set") to set the flag to true, or until the optional timeout occurs.

        When the timeout argument is present and not `None`, it should be a
        floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
        (or fractions thereof).

        This method returns `True` if and only if the internal flag has been set to
        true, either before the wait call or after the wait starts, so it will
        always return `True` except if a timeout is given and the operation
        times out.

        Changed in version 3.1: Previously, the method always returned `None`.

## Timer Objects

This class represents an action that should be run only after a certain amount
of time has passed — a timer. [`Timer`](threading.md#threading.Timer "threading.Timer") is a subclass of [`Thread`](threading.md#threading.Thread "threading.Thread")
and as such also functions as an example of creating custom threads.

Timers are started, as with threads, by calling their `start()`
method. The timer can be stopped (before its action has begun) by calling the
[`cancel()`](threading.md#threading.Timer.cancel "threading.Timer.cancel") method. The interval the timer will wait before
executing its action may not be exactly the same as the interval specified by
the user.

For example:

```python3
def hello():
    print("hello, world")

t = Timer(30.0, hello)
t.start()  # after 30 seconds, "hello, world" will be printed
```

`class threading.Timer(interval, function, args=None, kwargs=None)`
:   Create a timer that will run *function* with arguments *args* and keyword
    arguments *kwargs*, after *interval* seconds have passed.
    If *args* is `None` (the default) then an empty list will be used.
    If *kwargs* is `None` (the default) then an empty dict will be used.

    Changed in version 3.3: changed from a factory function to a class.

    `cancel()`
    :   Stop the timer, and cancel the execution of the timer’s action. This will
        only work if the timer is still in its waiting stage.

## Barrier Objects

New in version 3.2.

This class provides a simple synchronization primitive for use by a fixed number
of threads that need to wait for each other. Each of the threads tries to pass
the barrier by calling the [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Barrier.wait "threading.Barrier.wait") method and will block until
all of the threads have made their [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Barrier.wait "threading.Barrier.wait") calls. At this point,
the threads are released simultaneously.

The barrier can be reused any number of times for the same number of threads.

As an example, here is a simple way to synchronize a client and server thread:

```python3
b = Barrier(2, timeout=5)

def server():
    start_server()
    b.wait()
    while True:
        connection = accept_connection()
        process_server_connection(connection)

def client():
    b.wait()
    while True:
        connection = make_connection()
        process_client_connection(connection)
```

`class threading.Barrier(parties, action=None, timeout=None)`
:   Create a barrier object for *parties* number of threads. An *action*, when
    provided, is a callable to be called by one of the threads when they are
    released. *timeout* is the default timeout value if none is specified for
    the [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Barrier.wait "threading.Barrier.wait") method.

    `wait(timeout=None)`
    :   Pass the barrier. When all the threads party to the barrier have called
        this function, they are all released simultaneously. If a *timeout* is
        provided, it is used in preference to any that was supplied to the class
        constructor.

        The return value is an integer in the range 0 to *parties* – 1, different
        for each thread. This can be used to select a thread to do some special
        housekeeping, e.g.:

        ```python3
        i = barrier.wait()
        if i == 0:
            # Only one thread needs to print this
            print("passed the barrier")
        ```

        If an *action* was provided to the constructor, one of the threads will
        have called it prior to being released. Should this call raise an error,
        the barrier is put into the broken state.

        If the call times out, the barrier is put into the broken state.

        This method may raise a [`BrokenBarrierError`](threading.md#threading.BrokenBarrierError "threading.BrokenBarrierError") exception if the
        barrier is broken or reset while a thread is waiting.

    `reset()`
    :   Return the barrier to the default, empty state. Any threads waiting on it
        will receive the [`BrokenBarrierError`](threading.md#threading.BrokenBarrierError "threading.BrokenBarrierError") exception.

        Note that using this function may require some external
        synchronization if there are other threads whose state is unknown. If a
        barrier is broken it may be better to just leave it and create a new one.

    `abort()`
    :   Put the barrier into a broken state. This causes any active or future
        calls to [`wait()`](threading.md#threading.Barrier.wait "threading.Barrier.wait") to fail with the [`BrokenBarrierError`](threading.md#threading.BrokenBarrierError "threading.BrokenBarrierError"). Use
        this for example if one of the threads needs to abort, to avoid deadlocking the
        application.

        It may be preferable to simply create the barrier with a sensible
        *timeout* value to automatically guard against one of the threads going
        awry.

    `parties`
    :   The number of threads required to pass the barrier.

    `n_waiting`
    :   The number of threads currently waiting in the barrier.

    `broken`
    :   A boolean that is `True` if the barrier is in the broken state.

`exception threading.BrokenBarrierError`
:   This exception, a subclass of [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError"), is raised when the
    [`Barrier`](threading.md#threading.Barrier "threading.Barrier") object is reset or broken.

## Using locks, conditions, and semaphores in the `with` statement

All of the objects provided by this module that have `acquire()` and
`release()` methods can be used as context managers for a [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.10/reference/compound_stmts.html#with)
statement. The `acquire()` method will be called when the block is
entered, and `release()` will be called when the block is exited. Hence,
the following snippet:

```python3
with some_lock:
    # do something...
```

is equivalent to:

```python3
some_lock.acquire()
try:
    # do something...
finally:
    some_lock.release()
```

Currently, [`Lock`](threading.md#threading.Lock "threading.Lock"), [`RLock`](threading.md#threading.RLock "threading.RLock"), [`Condition`](threading.md#threading.Condition "threading.Condition"),
[`Semaphore`](threading.md#threading.Semaphore "threading.Semaphore"), and [`BoundedSemaphore`](threading.md#threading.BoundedSemaphore "threading.BoundedSemaphore") objects may be used as
[`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.10/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement context managers.
