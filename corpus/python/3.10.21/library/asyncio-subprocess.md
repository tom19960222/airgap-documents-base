This section describes high-level async/await asyncio APIs to
create and manage subprocesses.

Here’s an example of how asyncio can run a shell command and
obtain its result:

```python3
import asyncio

async def run(cmd):
    proc = await asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(
        cmd,
        stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE)

    stdout, stderr = await proc.communicate()

    print(f'[{cmd!r} exited with {proc.returncode}]')
    if stdout:
        print(f'[stdout]\n{stdout.decode()}')
    if stderr:
        print(f'[stderr]\n{stderr.decode()}')

asyncio.run(run('ls /zzz'))
```

will print:

```python3
['ls /zzz' exited with 1]
[stderr]
ls: /zzz: No such file or directory
```

Because all asyncio subprocess functions are asynchronous and asyncio
provides many tools to work with such functions, it is easy to execute
and monitor multiple subprocesses in parallel. It is indeed trivial
to modify the above example to run several commands simultaneously:

```python3
async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(
        run('ls /zzz'),
        run('sleep 1; echo "hello"'))

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Creating Subprocesses

`coroutine asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(program, *args, stdin=None, stdout=None, stderr=None, limit=None, **kwds)`
:   Create a subprocess.

    The *limit* argument sets the buffer limit for [`StreamReader`](asyncio-stream.md#asyncio.StreamReader "asyncio.StreamReader")
    wrappers for `Process.stdout` and `Process.stderr`
    (if [`subprocess.PIPE`](subprocess.md#subprocess.PIPE "subprocess.PIPE") is passed to *stdout* and *stderr* arguments).

    Return a [`Process`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process "asyncio.subprocess.Process") instance.

    See the documentation of [`loop.subprocess_exec()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.subprocess_exec "asyncio.loop.subprocess_exec") for other
    parameters.

    Changed in version 3.10: Removed the *loop* parameter.

`coroutine asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(cmd, stdin=None, stdout=None, stderr=None, limit=None, **kwds)`
:   Run the *cmd* shell command.

    The *limit* argument sets the buffer limit for [`StreamReader`](asyncio-stream.md#asyncio.StreamReader "asyncio.StreamReader")
    wrappers for `Process.stdout` and `Process.stderr`
    (if [`subprocess.PIPE`](subprocess.md#subprocess.PIPE "subprocess.PIPE") is passed to *stdout* and *stderr* arguments).

    Return a [`Process`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process "asyncio.subprocess.Process") instance.

    See the documentation of [`loop.subprocess_shell()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.subprocess_shell "asyncio.loop.subprocess_shell") for other
    parameters.

> as well as the [Subprocess Transports](asyncio-protocol.md#asyncio-subprocess-transports)
> and [Subprocess Protocols](asyncio-protocol.md#asyncio-subprocess-protocols).

## Constants

`asyncio.subprocess.PIPE`
:   Can be passed to the *stdin*, *stdout* or *stderr* parameters.

    If *PIPE* is passed to *stdin* argument, the
    [`Process.stdin`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process.stdin "asyncio.subprocess.Process.stdin") attribute
    will point to a `StreamWriter` instance.

    If *PIPE* is passed to *stdout* or *stderr* arguments, the
    [`Process.stdout`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process.stdout "asyncio.subprocess.Process.stdout") and
    [`Process.stderr`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process.stderr "asyncio.subprocess.Process.stderr")
    attributes will point to `StreamReader` instances.

`asyncio.subprocess.STDOUT`
:   Special value that can be used as the *stderr* argument and indicates
    that standard error should be redirected into standard output.

`asyncio.subprocess.DEVNULL`
:   Special value that can be used as the *stdin*, *stdout* or *stderr* argument
    to process creation functions. It indicates that the special file
    [`os.devnull`](os.md#os.devnull "os.devnull") will be used for the corresponding subprocess stream.

## Interacting with Subprocesses

Both [`create_subprocess_exec()`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.create_subprocess_exec "asyncio.create_subprocess_exec") and [`create_subprocess_shell()`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.create_subprocess_shell "asyncio.create_subprocess_shell")
functions return instances of the *Process* class. *Process* is a high-level
wrapper that allows communicating with subprocesses and watching for
their completion.

`class asyncio.subprocess.Process`
:   An object that wraps OS processes created by the
    `create_subprocess_exec()` and `create_subprocess_shell()`
    functions.

    This class is designed to have a similar API to the
    [`subprocess.Popen`](subprocess.md#subprocess.Popen "subprocess.Popen") class, but there are some
    notable differences:

    - unlike Popen, Process instances do not have an equivalent to
      the [`poll()`](subprocess.md#subprocess.Popen.poll "subprocess.Popen.poll") method;
    - the [`communicate()`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process.communicate "asyncio.subprocess.Process.communicate") and
      [`wait()`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process.wait "asyncio.subprocess.Process.wait") methods don’t have a
      *timeout* parameter: use the [`wait_for()`](asyncio-task.md#asyncio.wait_for "asyncio.wait_for") function;
    - the [`Process.wait()`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process.wait "asyncio.subprocess.Process.wait") method
      is asynchronous, whereas [`subprocess.Popen.wait()`](subprocess.md#subprocess.Popen.wait "subprocess.Popen.wait") method
      is implemented as a blocking busy loop;
    - the *universal_newlines* parameter is not supported.

    This class is [not thread safe](asyncio-dev.md#asyncio-multithreading).

    See also the [Subprocess and Threads](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio-subprocess-threads)
    section.

    `coroutine wait()`
    :   Wait for the child process to terminate.

        Set and return the [`returncode`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process.returncode "asyncio.subprocess.Process.returncode") attribute.

        > **Note:**
        >
        > This method can deadlock when using `stdout=PIPE` or
        > `stderr=PIPE` and the child process generates so much output
        > that it blocks waiting for the OS pipe buffer to accept
        > more data. Use the [`communicate()`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process.communicate "asyncio.subprocess.Process.communicate") method when using pipes
        > to avoid this condition.

    `coroutine communicate(input=None)`
    :   Interact with process:

        1. send data to *stdin* (if *input* is not `None`);
        2. read data from *stdout* and *stderr*, until EOF is reached;
        3. wait for process to terminate.

        The optional *input* argument is the data ([`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes "bytes") object)
        that will be sent to the child process.

        Return a tuple `(stdout_data, stderr_data)`.

        If either [`BrokenPipeError`](exceptions.md#BrokenPipeError "BrokenPipeError") or [`ConnectionResetError`](exceptions.md#ConnectionResetError "ConnectionResetError")
        exception is raised when writing *input* into *stdin*, the
        exception is ignored. This condition occurs when the process
        exits before all data are written into *stdin*.

        If it is desired to send data to the process’ *stdin*,
        the process needs to be created with `stdin=PIPE`. Similarly,
        to get anything other than `None` in the result tuple, the
        process has to be created with `stdout=PIPE` and/or
        `stderr=PIPE` arguments.

        Note, that the data read is buffered in memory, so do not use
        this method if the data size is large or unlimited.

    `send_signal(signal)`
    :   Sends the signal *signal* to the child process.

        > **Note:**
        >
        > On Windows, `SIGTERM` is an alias for [`terminate()`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process.terminate "asyncio.subprocess.Process.terminate").
        > `CTRL_C_EVENT` and `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` can be sent to processes
        > started with a *creationflags* parameter which includes
        > `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`.

    `terminate()`
    :   Stop the child process.

        On POSIX systems this method sends [`signal.SIGTERM`](signal.md#signal.SIGTERM "signal.SIGTERM") to the
        child process.

        On Windows the Win32 API function `TerminateProcess()` is
        called to stop the child process.

    `kill()`
    :   Kill the child process.

        On POSIX systems this method sends `SIGKILL` to the child
        process.

        On Windows this method is an alias for [`terminate()`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process.terminate "asyncio.subprocess.Process.terminate").

    `stdin`
    :   Standard input stream (`StreamWriter`) or `None`
        if the process was created with `stdin=None`.

    `stdout`
    :   Standard output stream (`StreamReader`) or `None`
        if the process was created with `stdout=None`.

    `stderr`
    :   Standard error stream (`StreamReader`) or `None`
        if the process was created with `stderr=None`.

    > **Warning:**
    >
    > Use the [`communicate()`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process.communicate "asyncio.subprocess.Process.communicate") method rather than
    > [`process.stdin.write()`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process.stdin "asyncio.subprocess.Process.stdin"),
    > [`await process.stdout.read()`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process.stdout "asyncio.subprocess.Process.stdout") or
    > [`await process.stderr.read()`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process.stderr "asyncio.subprocess.Process.stderr").
    > This avoids deadlocks due to streams pausing reading or writing
    > and blocking the child process.

    `pid`
    :   Process identification number (PID).

        Note that for processes created by the `create_subprocess_shell()`
        function, this attribute is the PID of the spawned shell.

    `returncode`
    :   Return code of the process when it exits.

        A `None` value indicates that the process has not terminated yet.

        A negative value `-N` indicates that the child was terminated
        by signal `N` (POSIX only).

### Subprocess and Threads

Standard asyncio event loop supports running subprocesses from different threads by
default.

On Windows subprocesses are provided by [`ProactorEventLoop`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.ProactorEventLoop "asyncio.ProactorEventLoop") only (default),
[`SelectorEventLoop`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.SelectorEventLoop "asyncio.SelectorEventLoop") has no subprocess support.

On UNIX *child watchers* are used for subprocess finish waiting, see
[Process Watchers](asyncio-policy.md#asyncio-watchers) for more info.

Changed in version 3.8: UNIX switched to use [`ThreadedChildWatcher`](asyncio-policy.md#asyncio.ThreadedChildWatcher "asyncio.ThreadedChildWatcher") for spawning subprocesses from
different threads without any limitation.

Spawning a subprocess with *inactive* current child watcher raises
[`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError").

Note that alternative event loop implementations might have own limitations;
please refer to their documentation.

### Examples

An example using the [`Process`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.subprocess.Process "asyncio.subprocess.Process") class to
control a subprocess and the [`StreamReader`](asyncio-stream.md#asyncio.StreamReader "asyncio.StreamReader") class to read from
its standard output.

The subprocess is created by the [`create_subprocess_exec()`](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio.create_subprocess_exec "asyncio.create_subprocess_exec")
function:

```python3
import asyncio
import sys

async def get_date():
    code = 'import datetime; print(datetime.datetime.now())'

    # Create the subprocess; redirect the standard output
    # into a pipe.
    proc = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(
        sys.executable, '-c', code,
        stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE)

    # Read one line of output.
    data = await proc.stdout.readline()
    line = data.decode('ascii').rstrip()

    # Wait for the subprocess exit.
    await proc.wait()
    return line

date = asyncio.run(get_date())
print(f"Current date: {date}")
```
