# `quopri` — Encode and decode MIME quoted-printable data

**Source code:** [Lib/quopri.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.10/Lib/quopri.py)

---

This module performs quoted-printable transport encoding and decoding, as
defined in [**RFC 1521**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1521.html): “MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One:
Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies”.
The quoted-printable encoding is designed for data where there are relatively
few nonprintable characters; the base64 encoding scheme available via the
[`base64`](base64.md#module-base64 "base64: RFC 4648: Base16, Base32, Base64 Data Encodings; Base85 and Ascii85") module is more compact if there are many such characters, as when
sending a graphics file.

`quopri.decode(input, output, header=False)`
:   Decode the contents of the *input* file and write the resulting decoded binary
    data to the *output* file. *input* and *output* must be [binary file objects](https://docs.python.org/3.10/glossary.html#term-file-object). If the optional argument *header* is present and true, underscore
    will be decoded as space. This is used to decode “Q”-encoded headers as
    described in [**RFC 1522**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1522.html): “MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
    Part Two: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text”.

`quopri.encode(input, output, quotetabs, header=False)`
:   Encode the contents of the *input* file and write the resulting quoted-printable
    data to the *output* file. *input* and *output* must be
    [binary file objects](https://docs.python.org/3.10/glossary.html#term-file-object). *quotetabs*, a
    non-optional flag which controls whether to encode embedded spaces
    and tabs; when true it encodes such embedded whitespace, and when
    false it leaves them unencoded.
    Note that spaces and tabs appearing at the end of lines are always encoded,
    as per [**RFC 1521**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1521.html). *header* is a flag which controls if spaces are encoded
    as underscores as per [**RFC 1522**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1522.html).

`quopri.decodestring(s, header=False)`
:   Like [`decode()`](quopri.md#quopri.decode "quopri.decode"), except that it accepts a source [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes "bytes") and
    returns the corresponding decoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes "bytes").

`quopri.encodestring(s, quotetabs=False, header=False)`
:   Like [`encode()`](quopri.md#quopri.encode "quopri.encode"), except that it accepts a source [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes "bytes") and
    returns the corresponding encoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes "bytes"). By default, it sends a
    `False` value to *quotetabs* parameter of the [`encode()`](quopri.md#quopri.encode "quopri.encode") function.
