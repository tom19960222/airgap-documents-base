# `doctest` — Test interactive Python examples

**Source code:** [Lib/doctest.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.10/Lib/doctest.py)

---

The [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") module searches for pieces of text that look like interactive
Python sessions, and then executes those sessions to verify that they work
exactly as shown. There are several common ways to use doctest:

- To check that a module’s docstrings are up-to-date by verifying that all
  interactive examples still work as documented.
- To perform regression testing by verifying that interactive examples from a
  test file or a test object work as expected.
- To write tutorial documentation for a package, liberally illustrated with
  input-output examples. Depending on whether the examples or the expository text
  are emphasized, this has the flavor of “literate testing” or “executable
  documentation”.

Here’s a complete but small example module:

```python3
"""
This is the "example" module.

The example module supplies one function, factorial().  For example,

>>> factorial(5)
120
"""

def factorial(n):
    """Return the factorial of n, an exact integer >= 0.

    >>> [factorial(n) for n in range(6)]
    [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120]
    >>> factorial(30)
    265252859812191058636308480000000
    >>> factorial(-1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: n must be >= 0

    Factorials of floats are OK, but the float must be an exact integer:
    >>> factorial(30.1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: n must be exact integer
    >>> factorial(30.0)
    265252859812191058636308480000000

    It must also not be ridiculously large:
    >>> factorial(1e100)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    OverflowError: n too large
    """

    import math
    if not n >= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be >= 0")
    if math.floor(n) != n:
        raise ValueError("n must be exact integer")
    if n+1 == n:  # catch a value like 1e300
        raise OverflowError("n too large")
    result = 1
    factor = 2
    while factor <= n:
        result *= factor
        factor += 1
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

If you run `example.py` directly from the command line, [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.")
works its magic:

```shell-session
$ python example.py
$
```

There’s no output! That’s normal, and it means all the examples worked. Pass
`-v` to the script, and [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") prints a detailed log of what
it’s trying, and prints a summary at the end:

```shell-session
$ python example.py -v
Trying:
    factorial(5)
Expecting:
    120
ok
Trying:
    [factorial(n) for n in range(6)]
Expecting:
    [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120]
ok
```

And so on, eventually ending with:

```
Trying:
    factorial(1e100)
Expecting:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    OverflowError: n too large
ok
2 items passed all tests:
   1 tests in __main__
   8 tests in __main__.factorial
9 tests in 2 items.
9 passed and 0 failed.
Test passed.
$
```

That’s all you need to know to start making productive use of [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.")!
Jump in. The following sections provide full details. Note that there are many
examples of doctests in the standard Python test suite and libraries.
Especially useful examples can be found in the standard test file
`Lib/test/test_doctest.py`.

## Simple Usage: Checking Examples in Docstrings

The simplest way to start using doctest (but not necessarily the way you’ll
continue to do it) is to end each module `M` with:

```python3
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

[`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") then examines docstrings in module `M`.

Running the module as a script causes the examples in the docstrings to get
executed and verified:

```python3
python M.py
```

This won’t display anything unless an example fails, in which case the failing
example(s) and the cause(s) of the failure(s) are printed to stdout, and the
final line of output is `***Test Failed*** N failures.`, where *N* is the
number of examples that failed.

Run it with the `-v` switch instead:

```python3
python M.py -v
```

and a detailed report of all examples tried is printed to standard output, along
with assorted summaries at the end.

You can force verbose mode by passing `verbose=True` to [`testmod()`](doctest.md#doctest.testmod "doctest.testmod"), or
prohibit it by passing `verbose=False`. In either of those cases,
`sys.argv` is not examined by [`testmod()`](doctest.md#doctest.testmod "doctest.testmod") (so passing `-v` or not
has no effect).

There is also a command line shortcut for running [`testmod()`](doctest.md#doctest.testmod "doctest.testmod"). You can
instruct the Python interpreter to run the doctest module directly from the
standard library and pass the module name(s) on the command line:

```python3
python -m doctest -v example.py
```

This will import `example.py` as a standalone module and run
[`testmod()`](doctest.md#doctest.testmod "doctest.testmod") on it. Note that this may not work correctly if the file is
part of a package and imports other submodules from that package.

For more information on [`testmod()`](doctest.md#doctest.testmod "doctest.testmod"), see section [Basic API](doctest.md#doctest-basic-api).

## Simple Usage: Checking Examples in a Text File

Another simple application of doctest is testing interactive examples in a text
file. This can be done with the [`testfile()`](doctest.md#doctest.testfile "doctest.testfile") function:

```python3
import doctest
doctest.testfile("example.txt")
```

That short script executes and verifies any interactive Python examples
contained in the file `example.txt`. The file content is treated as if it
were a single giant docstring; the file doesn’t need to contain a Python
program! For example, perhaps `example.txt` contains this:

```
The ``example`` module
======================

Using ``factorial``
-------------------

This is an example text file in reStructuredText format.  First import
``factorial`` from the ``example`` module:

    >>> from example import factorial

Now use it:

    >>> factorial(6)
    120
```

Running `doctest.testfile("example.txt")` then finds the error in this
documentation:

```python3
File "./example.txt", line 14, in example.txt
Failed example:
    factorial(6)
Expected:
    120
Got:
    720
```

As with [`testmod()`](doctest.md#doctest.testmod "doctest.testmod"), [`testfile()`](doctest.md#doctest.testfile "doctest.testfile") won’t display anything unless an
example fails. If an example does fail, then the failing example(s) and the
cause(s) of the failure(s) are printed to stdout, using the same format as
[`testmod()`](doctest.md#doctest.testmod "doctest.testmod").

By default, [`testfile()`](doctest.md#doctest.testfile "doctest.testfile") looks for files in the calling module’s directory.
See section [Basic API](doctest.md#doctest-basic-api) for a description of the optional arguments
that can be used to tell it to look for files in other locations.

Like [`testmod()`](doctest.md#doctest.testmod "doctest.testmod"), [`testfile()`](doctest.md#doctest.testfile "doctest.testfile")’s verbosity can be set with the
`-v` command-line switch or with the optional keyword argument
*verbose*.

There is also a command line shortcut for running [`testfile()`](doctest.md#doctest.testfile "doctest.testfile"). You can
instruct the Python interpreter to run the doctest module directly from the
standard library and pass the file name(s) on the command line:

```python3
python -m doctest -v example.txt
```

Because the file name does not end with `.py`, [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") infers that
it must be run with [`testfile()`](doctest.md#doctest.testfile "doctest.testfile"), not [`testmod()`](doctest.md#doctest.testmod "doctest.testmod").

For more information on [`testfile()`](doctest.md#doctest.testfile "doctest.testfile"), see section [Basic API](doctest.md#doctest-basic-api).

## How It Works

This section examines in detail how doctest works: which docstrings it looks at,
how it finds interactive examples, what execution context it uses, how it
handles exceptions, and how option flags can be used to control its behavior.
This is the information that you need to know to write doctest examples; for
information about actually running doctest on these examples, see the following
sections.

### Which Docstrings Are Examined?

The module docstring, and all function, class and method docstrings are
searched. Objects imported into the module are not searched.

In addition, if `M.__test__` exists and “is true”, it must be a dict, and each
entry maps a (string) name to a function object, class object, or string.
Function and class object docstrings found from `M.__test__` are searched, and
strings are treated as if they were docstrings. In output, a key `K` in
`M.__test__` appears with name

```python3
<name of M>.__test__.K
```

Any classes found are recursively searched similarly, to test docstrings in
their contained methods and nested classes.

### How are Docstring Examples Recognized?

In most cases a copy-and-paste of an interactive console session works fine,
but doctest isn’t trying to do an exact emulation of any specific Python shell.

```python3
>>> # comments are ignored
>>> x = 12
>>> x
12
>>> if x == 13:
...     print("yes")
... else:
...     print("no")
...     print("NO")
...     print("NO!!!")
...
no
NO
NO!!!
>>>
```

Any expected output must immediately follow the final `'>>> '` or `'... '`
line containing the code, and the expected output (if any) extends to the next
`'>>> '` or all-whitespace line.

The fine print:

- Expected output cannot contain an all-whitespace line, since such a line is
  taken to signal the end of expected output. If expected output does contain a
  blank line, put `<BLANKLINE>` in your doctest example each place a blank line
  is expected.
- All hard tab characters are expanded to spaces, using 8-column tab stops.
  Tabs in output generated by the tested code are not modified. Because any
  hard tabs in the sample output *are* expanded, this means that if the code
  output includes hard tabs, the only way the doctest can pass is if the
  [`NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE`](doctest.md#doctest.NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE "doctest.NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE") option or [directive](doctest.md#doctest-directives)
  is in effect.
  Alternatively, the test can be rewritten to capture the output and compare it
  to an expected value as part of the test. This handling of tabs in the
  source was arrived at through trial and error, and has proven to be the least
  error prone way of handling them. It is possible to use a different
  algorithm for handling tabs by writing a custom [`DocTestParser`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestParser "doctest.DocTestParser") class.
- Output to stdout is captured, but not output to stderr (exception tracebacks
  are captured via a different means).
- If you continue a line via backslashing in an interactive session, or for any
  other reason use a backslash, you should use a raw docstring, which will
  preserve your backslashes exactly as you type them:

  ```python3
  >>> def f(x):
  ...     r'''Backslashes in a raw docstring: m\n'''
  >>> print(f.__doc__)
  Backslashes in a raw docstring: m\n
  ```

  Otherwise, the backslash will be interpreted as part of the string. For example,
  the `\n` above would be interpreted as a newline character. Alternatively, you
  can double each backslash in the doctest version (and not use a raw string):

  ```python3
  >>> def f(x):
  ...     '''Backslashes in a raw docstring: m\\n'''
  >>> print(f.__doc__)
  Backslashes in a raw docstring: m\n
  ```
- The starting column doesn’t matter:

  ```python3
  >>> assert "Easy!"
        >>> import math
            >>> math.floor(1.9)
            1
  ```

  and as many leading whitespace characters are stripped from the expected output
  as appeared in the initial `'>>> '` line that started the example.

### What’s the Execution Context?

By default, each time [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") finds a docstring to test, it uses a
*shallow copy* of `M`’s globals, so that running tests doesn’t change the
module’s real globals, and so that one test in `M` can’t leave behind
crumbs that accidentally allow another test to work. This means examples can
freely use any names defined at top-level in `M`, and names defined earlier
in the docstring being run. Examples cannot see names defined in other
docstrings.

You can force use of your own dict as the execution context by passing
`globs=your_dict` to [`testmod()`](doctest.md#doctest.testmod "doctest.testmod") or [`testfile()`](doctest.md#doctest.testfile "doctest.testfile") instead.

### What About Exceptions?

No problem, provided that the traceback is the only output produced by the
example: just paste in the traceback. [1](doctest.md#id2) Since tracebacks contain details
that are likely to change rapidly (for example, exact file paths and line
numbers), this is one case where doctest works hard to be flexible in what it
accepts.

Simple example:

```python3
>>> [1, 2, 3].remove(42)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list
```

That doctest succeeds if [`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError "ValueError") is raised, with the `list.remove(x):
x not in list` detail as shown.

The expected output for an exception must start with a traceback header, which
may be either of the following two lines, indented the same as the first line of
the example:

```python3
Traceback (most recent call last):
Traceback (innermost last):
```

The traceback header is followed by an optional traceback stack, whose contents
are ignored by doctest. The traceback stack is typically omitted, or copied
verbatim from an interactive session.

The traceback stack is followed by the most interesting part: the line(s)
containing the exception type and detail. This is usually the last line of a
traceback, but can extend across multiple lines if the exception has a
multi-line detail:

```python3
>>> raise ValueError('multi\n    line\ndetail')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: multi
    line
detail
```

The last three lines (starting with [`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError "ValueError")) are compared against the
exception’s type and detail, and the rest are ignored.

Best practice is to omit the traceback stack, unless it adds significant
documentation value to the example. So the last example is probably better as:

```python3
>>> raise ValueError('multi\n    line\ndetail')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ValueError: multi
    line
detail
```

Note that tracebacks are treated very specially. In particular, in the
rewritten example, the use of `...` is independent of doctest’s
[`ELLIPSIS`](doctest.md#doctest.ELLIPSIS "doctest.ELLIPSIS") option. The ellipsis in that example could be left out, or
could just as well be three (or three hundred) commas or digits, or an indented
transcript of a Monty Python skit.

Some details you should read once, but won’t need to remember:

- Doctest can’t guess whether your expected output came from an exception
  traceback or from ordinary printing. So, e.g., an example that expects
  `ValueError: 42 is prime` will pass whether [`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError "ValueError") is actually
  raised or if the example merely prints that traceback text. In practice,
  ordinary output rarely begins with a traceback header line, so this doesn’t
  create real problems.
- Each line of the traceback stack (if present) must be indented further than
  the first line of the example, *or* start with a non-alphanumeric character.
  The first line following the traceback header indented the same and starting
  with an alphanumeric is taken to be the start of the exception detail. Of
  course this does the right thing for genuine tracebacks.
- When the [`IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL`](doctest.md#doctest.IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL "doctest.IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL") doctest option is specified,
  everything following the leftmost colon and any module information in the
  exception name is ignored.
- The interactive shell omits the traceback header line for some
  [`SyntaxError`](exceptions.md#SyntaxError "SyntaxError")s. But doctest uses the traceback header line to
  distinguish exceptions from non-exceptions. So in the rare case where you need
  to test a [`SyntaxError`](exceptions.md#SyntaxError "SyntaxError") that omits the traceback header, you will need to
  manually add the traceback header line to your test example.

- For some [`SyntaxError`](exceptions.md#SyntaxError "SyntaxError")s, Python displays the character position of the
  syntax error, using a `^` marker:

  ```python3
  >>> 1 1
    File "<stdin>", line 1
      1 1
        ^
  SyntaxError: invalid syntax
  ```

  Since the lines showing the position of the error come before the exception type
  and detail, they are not checked by doctest. For example, the following test
  would pass, even though it puts the `^` marker in the wrong location:

  ```python3
  >>> 1 1
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1
      1 1
      ^
  SyntaxError: invalid syntax
  ```

### Option Flags

A number of option flags control various aspects of doctest’s behavior.
Symbolic names for the flags are supplied as module constants, which can be
[bitwise ORed](https://docs.python.org/3.10/reference/expressions.html#bitwise) together and passed to various functions.
The names can also be used in [doctest directives](doctest.md#doctest-directives),
and may be passed to the doctest command line interface via the `-o` option.

New in version 3.4: The `-o` command line option.

The first group of options define test semantics, controlling aspects of how
doctest decides whether actual output matches an example’s expected output:

`doctest.DONT_ACCEPT_TRUE_FOR_1`
:   By default, if an expected output block contains just `1`, an actual output
    block containing just `1` or just `True` is considered to be a match, and
    similarly for `0` versus `False`. When [`DONT_ACCEPT_TRUE_FOR_1`](doctest.md#doctest.DONT_ACCEPT_TRUE_FOR_1 "doctest.DONT_ACCEPT_TRUE_FOR_1") is
    specified, neither substitution is allowed. The default behavior caters to that
    Python changed the return type of many functions from integer to boolean;
    doctests expecting “little integer” output still work in these cases. This
    option will probably go away, but not for several years.

`doctest.DONT_ACCEPT_BLANKLINE`
:   By default, if an expected output block contains a line containing only the
    string `<BLANKLINE>`, then that line will match a blank line in the actual
    output. Because a genuinely blank line delimits the expected output, this is
    the only way to communicate that a blank line is expected. When
    [`DONT_ACCEPT_BLANKLINE`](doctest.md#doctest.DONT_ACCEPT_BLANKLINE "doctest.DONT_ACCEPT_BLANKLINE") is specified, this substitution is not allowed.

`doctest.NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE`
:   When specified, all sequences of whitespace (blanks and newlines) are treated as
    equal. Any sequence of whitespace within the expected output will match any
    sequence of whitespace within the actual output. By default, whitespace must
    match exactly. [`NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE`](doctest.md#doctest.NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE "doctest.NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE") is especially useful when a line of
    expected output is very long, and you want to wrap it across multiple lines in
    your source.

`doctest.ELLIPSIS`
:   When specified, an ellipsis marker (`...`) in the expected output can match
    any substring in the actual output. This includes substrings that span line
    boundaries, and empty substrings, so it’s best to keep usage of this simple.
    Complicated uses can lead to the same kinds of “oops, it matched too much!”
    surprises that `.*` is prone to in regular expressions.

`doctest.IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL`
:   When specified, doctests expecting exceptions pass so long as an exception
    of the expected type is raised, even if the details
    (message and fully qualified exception name) don’t match.

    For example, an example expecting `ValueError: 42` will pass if the actual
    exception raised is `ValueError: 3*14`, but will fail if, say, a
    [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError "TypeError") is raised instead.
    It will also ignore any fully qualified name included before the
    exception class, which can vary between implementations and versions
    of Python and the code/libraries in use.
    Hence, all three of these variations will work with the flag specified:

    ```pycon
    >>> raise Exception('message')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    Exception: message

    >>> raise Exception('message')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    builtins.Exception: message

    >>> raise Exception('message')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    __main__.Exception: message
    ```

    Note that [`ELLIPSIS`](doctest.md#doctest.ELLIPSIS "doctest.ELLIPSIS") can also be used to ignore the
    details of the exception message, but such a test may still fail based
    on whether the module name is present or matches exactly.

    Changed in version 3.2: [`IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL`](doctest.md#doctest.IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL "doctest.IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL") now also ignores any information relating
    to the module containing the exception under test.

`doctest.SKIP`
:   When specified, do not run the example at all. This can be useful in contexts
    where doctest examples serve as both documentation and test cases, and an
    example should be included for documentation purposes, but should not be
    checked. E.g., the example’s output might be random; or the example might
    depend on resources which would be unavailable to the test driver.

    The SKIP flag can also be used for temporarily “commenting out” examples.

`doctest.COMPARISON_FLAGS`
:   A bitmask or’ing together all the comparison flags above.

The second group of options controls how test failures are reported:

`doctest.REPORT_UDIFF`
:   When specified, failures that involve multi-line expected and actual outputs are
    displayed using a unified diff.

`doctest.REPORT_CDIFF`
:   When specified, failures that involve multi-line expected and actual outputs
    will be displayed using a context diff.

`doctest.REPORT_NDIFF`
:   When specified, differences are computed by `difflib.Differ`, using the same
    algorithm as the popular `ndiff.py` utility. This is the only method that
    marks differences within lines as well as across lines. For example, if a line
    of expected output contains digit `1` where actual output contains letter
    `l`, a line is inserted with a caret marking the mismatching column positions.

`doctest.REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE`
:   When specified, display the first failing example in each doctest, but suppress
    output for all remaining examples. This will prevent doctest from reporting
    correct examples that break because of earlier failures; but it might also hide
    incorrect examples that fail independently of the first failure. When
    [`REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE`](doctest.md#doctest.REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE "doctest.REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE") is specified, the remaining examples are
    still run, and still count towards the total number of failures reported; only
    the output is suppressed.

`doctest.FAIL_FAST`
:   When specified, exit after the first failing example and don’t attempt to run
    the remaining examples. Thus, the number of failures reported will be at most
    1. This flag may be useful during debugging, since examples after the first
    failure won’t even produce debugging output.

    The doctest command line accepts the option `-f` as a shorthand for `-o
    FAIL_FAST`.

    New in version 3.4.

`doctest.REPORTING_FLAGS`
:   A bitmask or’ing together all the reporting flags above.

There is also a way to register new option flag names, though this isn’t
useful unless you intend to extend [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") internals via subclassing:

`doctest.register_optionflag(name)`
:   Create a new option flag with a given name, and return the new flag’s integer
    value. [`register_optionflag()`](doctest.md#doctest.register_optionflag "doctest.register_optionflag") can be used when subclassing
    [`OutputChecker`](doctest.md#doctest.OutputChecker "doctest.OutputChecker") or [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner") to create new options that are
    supported by your subclasses. [`register_optionflag()`](doctest.md#doctest.register_optionflag "doctest.register_optionflag") should always be
    called using the following idiom:

    ```python3
    MY_FLAG = register_optionflag('MY_FLAG')
    ```

### Directives

Doctest directives may be used to modify the [option flags](doctest.md#doctest-options) for an individual example. Doctest directives are
special Python comments following an example’s source code:

```
directive             ::=  "#" "doctest:" directive_options
directive_options     ::=  directive_option ("," directive_option)*
directive_option      ::=  on_or_off directive_option_name
on_or_off             ::=  "+" | "-"
directive_option_name ::=  "DONT_ACCEPT_BLANKLINE" | "NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE" | ...
```

Whitespace is not allowed between the `+` or `-` and the directive option
name. The directive option name can be any of the option flag names explained
above.

An example’s doctest directives modify doctest’s behavior for that single
example. Use `+` to enable the named behavior, or `-` to disable it.

For example, this test passes:

```pycon3
>>> print(list(range(20)))  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
[0,   1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,
10,  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
```

Without the directive it would fail, both because the actual output doesn’t have
two blanks before the single-digit list elements, and because the actual output
is on a single line. This test also passes, and also requires a directive to do
so:

```pycon3
>>> print(list(range(20)))  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
[0, 1, ..., 18, 19]
```

Multiple directives can be used on a single physical line, separated by
commas:

```pycon3
>>> print(list(range(20)))  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
[0,    1, ...,   18,    19]
```

If multiple directive comments are used for a single example, then they are
combined:

```pycon3
>>> print(list(range(20)))  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
...                         # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
[0,    1, ...,   18,    19]
```

As the previous example shows, you can add `...` lines to your example
containing only directives. This can be useful when an example is too long for
a directive to comfortably fit on the same line:

```pycon3
>>> print(list(range(5)) + list(range(10, 20)) + list(range(30, 40)))
... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
[0, ..., 4, 10, ..., 19, 30, ..., 39]
```

Note that since all options are disabled by default, and directives apply only
to the example they appear in, enabling options (via `+` in a directive) is
usually the only meaningful choice. However, option flags can also be passed to
functions that run doctests, establishing different defaults. In such cases,
disabling an option via `-` in a directive can be useful.

### Warnings

[`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") is serious about requiring exact matches in expected output. If
even a single character doesn’t match, the test fails. This will probably
surprise you a few times, as you learn exactly what Python does and doesn’t
guarantee about output. For example, when printing a set, Python doesn’t
guarantee that the element is printed in any particular order, so a test like

```python3
>>> foo()
{"Hermione", "Harry"}
```

is vulnerable! One workaround is to do

```python3
>>> foo() == {"Hermione", "Harry"}
True
```

instead. Another is to do

```python3
>>> d = sorted(foo())
>>> d
['Harry', 'Hermione']
```

There are others, but you get the idea.

Another bad idea is to print things that embed an object address, like

```pycon3
>>> id(1.0)  # certain to fail some of the time  
7948648
>>> class C: pass
>>> C()  # the default repr() for instances embeds an address   
<C object at 0x00AC18F0>
```

The [`ELLIPSIS`](doctest.md#doctest.ELLIPSIS "doctest.ELLIPSIS") directive gives a nice approach for the last example:

```pycon3
>>> C()  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
<C object at 0x...>
```

Floating-point numbers are also subject to small output variations across
platforms, because Python defers to the platform C library for float formatting,
and C libraries vary widely in quality here.

```python3
>>> 1./7  # risky
0.14285714285714285
>>> print(1./7) # safer
0.142857142857
>>> print(round(1./7, 6)) # much safer
0.142857
```

Numbers of the form `I/2.**J` are safe across all platforms, and I often
contrive doctest examples to produce numbers of that form:

```python3
>>> 3./4  # utterly safe
0.75
```

Simple fractions are also easier for people to understand, and that makes for
better documentation.

## Basic API

The functions [`testmod()`](doctest.md#doctest.testmod "doctest.testmod") and [`testfile()`](doctest.md#doctest.testfile "doctest.testfile") provide a simple interface to
doctest that should be sufficient for most basic uses. For a less formal
introduction to these two functions, see sections [Simple Usage: Checking Examples in Docstrings](doctest.md#doctest-simple-testmod)
and [Simple Usage: Checking Examples in a Text File](doctest.md#doctest-simple-testfile).

`doctest.testfile(filename, module_relative=True, name=None, package=None, globs=None, verbose=None, report=True, optionflags=0, extraglobs=None, raise_on_error=False, parser=DocTestParser(), encoding=None)`
:   All arguments except *filename* are optional, and should be specified in keyword
    form.

    Test examples in the file named *filename*. Return `(failure_count,
    test_count)`.

    Optional argument *module_relative* specifies how the filename should be
    interpreted:

    - If *module_relative* is `True` (the default), then *filename* specifies an
      OS-independent module-relative path. By default, this path is relative to the
      calling module’s directory; but if the *package* argument is specified, then it
      is relative to that package. To ensure OS-independence, *filename* should use
      `/` characters to separate path segments, and may not be an absolute path
      (i.e., it may not begin with `/`).
    - If *module_relative* is `False`, then *filename* specifies an OS-specific
      path. The path may be absolute or relative; relative paths are resolved with
      respect to the current working directory.

    Optional argument *name* gives the name of the test; by default, or if `None`,
    `os.path.basename(filename)` is used.

    Optional argument *package* is a Python package or the name of a Python package
    whose directory should be used as the base directory for a module-relative
    filename. If no package is specified, then the calling module’s directory is
    used as the base directory for module-relative filenames. It is an error to
    specify *package* if *module_relative* is `False`.

    Optional argument *globs* gives a dict to be used as the globals when executing
    examples. A new shallow copy of this dict is created for the doctest, so its
    examples start with a clean slate. By default, or if `None`, a new empty dict
    is used.

    Optional argument *extraglobs* gives a dict merged into the globals used to
    execute examples. This works like [`dict.update()`](stdtypes.md#dict.update "dict.update"): if *globs* and
    *extraglobs* have a common key, the associated value in *extraglobs* appears in
    the combined dict. By default, or if `None`, no extra globals are used. This
    is an advanced feature that allows parameterization of doctests. For example, a
    doctest can be written for a base class, using a generic name for the class,
    then reused to test any number of subclasses by passing an *extraglobs* dict
    mapping the generic name to the subclass to be tested.

    Optional argument *verbose* prints lots of stuff if true, and prints only
    failures if false; by default, or if `None`, it’s true if and only if `'-v'`
    is in `sys.argv`.

    Optional argument *report* prints a summary at the end when true, else prints
    nothing at the end. In verbose mode, the summary is detailed, else the summary
    is very brief (in fact, empty if all tests passed).

    Optional argument *optionflags* (default value 0) takes the
    [bitwise OR](https://docs.python.org/3.10/reference/expressions.html#bitwise) of option flags.
    See section [Option Flags](doctest.md#doctest-options).

    Optional argument *raise_on_error* defaults to false. If true, an exception is
    raised upon the first failure or unexpected exception in an example. This
    allows failures to be post-mortem debugged. Default behavior is to continue
    running examples.

    Optional argument *parser* specifies a [`DocTestParser`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestParser "doctest.DocTestParser") (or subclass) that
    should be used to extract tests from the files. It defaults to a normal parser
    (i.e., `DocTestParser()`).

    Optional argument *encoding* specifies an encoding that should be used to
    convert the file to unicode.

`doctest.testmod(m=None, name=None, globs=None, verbose=None, report=True, optionflags=0, extraglobs=None, raise_on_error=False, exclude_empty=False)`
:   All arguments are optional, and all except for *m* should be specified in
    keyword form.

    Test examples in docstrings in functions and classes reachable from module *m*
    (or module [`__main__`](__main__.md#module-__main__ "__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``.") if *m* is not supplied or is `None`), starting with
    `m.__doc__`.

    Also test examples reachable from dict `m.__test__`, if it exists and is not
    `None`. `m.__test__` maps names (strings) to functions, classes and
    strings; function and class docstrings are searched for examples; strings are
    searched directly, as if they were docstrings.

    Only docstrings attached to objects belonging to module *m* are searched.

    Return `(failure_count, test_count)`.

    Optional argument *name* gives the name of the module; by default, or if
    `None`, `m.__name__` is used.

    Optional argument *exclude_empty* defaults to false. If true, objects for which
    no doctests are found are excluded from consideration. The default is a backward
    compatibility hack, so that code still using `doctest.master.summarize()` in
    conjunction with [`testmod()`](doctest.md#doctest.testmod "doctest.testmod") continues to get output for objects with no
    tests. The *exclude_empty* argument to the newer [`DocTestFinder`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestFinder "doctest.DocTestFinder")
    constructor defaults to true.

    Optional arguments *extraglobs*, *verbose*, *report*, *optionflags*,
    *raise_on_error*, and *globs* are the same as for function [`testfile()`](doctest.md#doctest.testfile "doctest.testfile")
    above, except that *globs* defaults to `m.__dict__`.

`doctest.run_docstring_examples(f, globs, verbose=False, name='NoName', compileflags=None, optionflags=0)`
:   Test examples associated with object *f*; for example, *f* may be a string,
    a module, a function, or a class object.

    A shallow copy of dictionary argument *globs* is used for the execution context.

    Optional argument *name* is used in failure messages, and defaults to
    `"NoName"`.

    If optional argument *verbose* is true, output is generated even if there are no
    failures. By default, output is generated only in case of an example failure.

    Optional argument *compileflags* gives the set of flags that should be used by
    the Python compiler when running the examples. By default, or if `None`,
    flags are deduced corresponding to the set of future features found in *globs*.

    Optional argument *optionflags* works as for function [`testfile()`](doctest.md#doctest.testfile "doctest.testfile") above.

## Unittest API

As your collection of doctest’ed modules grows, you’ll want a way to run all
their doctests systematically. [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") provides two functions that can
be used to create [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") test suites from modules and text files
containing doctests. To integrate with [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") test discovery, include
a `load_tests()` function in your test module:

```python3
import unittest
import doctest
import my_module_with_doctests

def load_tests(loader, tests, ignore):
    tests.addTests(doctest.DocTestSuite(my_module_with_doctests))
    return tests
```

There are two main functions for creating [`unittest.TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") instances
from text files and modules with doctests:

`doctest.DocFileSuite(*paths, module_relative=True, package=None, setUp=None, tearDown=None, globs=None, optionflags=0, parser=DocTestParser(), encoding=None)`
:   Convert doctest tests from one or more text files to a
    [`unittest.TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite").

    The returned [`unittest.TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") is to be run by the unittest framework
    and runs the interactive examples in each file. If an example in any file
    fails, then the synthesized unit test fails, and a `failureException`
    exception is raised showing the name of the file containing the test and a
    (sometimes approximate) line number.

    Pass one or more paths (as strings) to text files to be examined.

    Options may be provided as keyword arguments:

    Optional argument *module_relative* specifies how the filenames in *paths*
    should be interpreted:

    - If *module_relative* is `True` (the default), then each filename in
      *paths* specifies an OS-independent module-relative path. By default, this
      path is relative to the calling module’s directory; but if the *package*
      argument is specified, then it is relative to that package. To ensure
      OS-independence, each filename should use `/` characters to separate path
      segments, and may not be an absolute path (i.e., it may not begin with
      `/`).
    - If *module_relative* is `False`, then each filename in *paths* specifies
      an OS-specific path. The path may be absolute or relative; relative paths
      are resolved with respect to the current working directory.

    Optional argument *package* is a Python package or the name of a Python
    package whose directory should be used as the base directory for
    module-relative filenames in *paths*. If no package is specified, then the
    calling module’s directory is used as the base directory for module-relative
    filenames. It is an error to specify *package* if *module_relative* is
    `False`.

    Optional argument *setUp* specifies a set-up function for the test suite.
    This is called before running the tests in each file. The *setUp* function
    will be passed a [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") object. The setUp function can access the
    test globals as the *globs* attribute of the test passed.

    Optional argument *tearDown* specifies a tear-down function for the test
    suite. This is called after running the tests in each file. The *tearDown*
    function will be passed a [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") object. The setUp function can
    access the test globals as the *globs* attribute of the test passed.

    Optional argument *globs* is a dictionary containing the initial global
    variables for the tests. A new copy of this dictionary is created for each
    test. By default, *globs* is a new empty dictionary.

    Optional argument *optionflags* specifies the default doctest options for the
    tests, created by or-ing together individual option flags. See section
    [Option Flags](doctest.md#doctest-options). See function [`set_unittest_reportflags()`](doctest.md#doctest.set_unittest_reportflags "doctest.set_unittest_reportflags") below
    for a better way to set reporting options.

    Optional argument *parser* specifies a [`DocTestParser`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestParser "doctest.DocTestParser") (or subclass)
    that should be used to extract tests from the files. It defaults to a normal
    parser (i.e., `DocTestParser()`).

    Optional argument *encoding* specifies an encoding that should be used to
    convert the file to unicode.

    The global `__file__` is added to the globals provided to doctests loaded
    from a text file using [`DocFileSuite()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocFileSuite "doctest.DocFileSuite").

`doctest.DocTestSuite(module=None, globs=None, extraglobs=None, test_finder=None, setUp=None, tearDown=None, checker=None)`
:   Convert doctest tests for a module to a [`unittest.TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite").

    The returned [`unittest.TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") is to be run by the unittest framework
    and runs each doctest in the module. If any of the doctests fail, then the
    synthesized unit test fails, and a `failureException` exception is raised
    showing the name of the file containing the test and a (sometimes approximate)
    line number.

    Optional argument *module* provides the module to be tested. It can be a module
    object or a (possibly dotted) module name. If not specified, the module calling
    this function is used.

    Optional argument *globs* is a dictionary containing the initial global
    variables for the tests. A new copy of this dictionary is created for each
    test. By default, *globs* is a new empty dictionary.

    Optional argument *extraglobs* specifies an extra set of global variables, which
    is merged into *globs*. By default, no extra globals are used.

    Optional argument *test_finder* is the [`DocTestFinder`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestFinder "doctest.DocTestFinder") object (or a
    drop-in replacement) that is used to extract doctests from the module.

    Optional arguments *setUp*, *tearDown*, and *optionflags* are the same as for
    function [`DocFileSuite()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocFileSuite "doctest.DocFileSuite") above.

    This function uses the same search technique as [`testmod()`](doctest.md#doctest.testmod "doctest.testmod").

    Changed in version 3.5: [`DocTestSuite()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestSuite "doctest.DocTestSuite") returns an empty [`unittest.TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") if *module*
    contains no docstrings instead of raising [`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError "ValueError").

Under the covers, [`DocTestSuite()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestSuite "doctest.DocTestSuite") creates a [`unittest.TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") out
of `doctest.DocTestCase` instances, and `DocTestCase` is a
subclass of [`unittest.TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase"). `DocTestCase` isn’t documented
here (it’s an internal detail), but studying its code can answer questions about
the exact details of [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") integration.

Similarly, [`DocFileSuite()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocFileSuite "doctest.DocFileSuite") creates a [`unittest.TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") out of
`doctest.DocFileCase` instances, and `DocFileCase` is a subclass
of `DocTestCase`.

So both ways of creating a [`unittest.TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") run instances of
`DocTestCase`. This is important for a subtle reason: when you run
[`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") functions yourself, you can control the [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") options in
use directly, by passing option flags to [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") functions. However, if
you’re writing a [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") framework, [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") ultimately controls
when and how tests get run. The framework author typically wants to control
[`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") reporting options (perhaps, e.g., specified by command line
options), but there’s no way to pass options through [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") to
[`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") test runners.

For this reason, [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") also supports a notion of [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.")
reporting flags specific to [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") support, via this function:

`doctest.set_unittest_reportflags(flags)`
:   Set the [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") reporting flags to use.

    Argument *flags* takes the [bitwise OR](https://docs.python.org/3.10/reference/expressions.html#bitwise) of option flags. See
    section [Option Flags](doctest.md#doctest-options). Only “reporting flags” can be used.

    This is a module-global setting, and affects all future doctests run by module
    [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python."): the `runTest()` method of `DocTestCase` looks at
    the option flags specified for the test case when the `DocTestCase`
    instance was constructed. If no reporting flags were specified (which is the
    typical and expected case), [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.")’s [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") reporting flags are
    [bitwise ORed](https://docs.python.org/3.10/reference/expressions.html#bitwise) into the option flags, and the option flags
    so augmented are passed to the [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner") instance created to
    run the doctest. If any reporting flags were specified when the
    `DocTestCase` instance was constructed, [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.")’s
    [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") reporting flags are ignored.

    The value of the [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") reporting flags in effect before the function
    was called is returned by the function.

## Advanced API

The basic API is a simple wrapper that’s intended to make doctest easy to use.
It is fairly flexible, and should meet most users’ needs; however, if you
require more fine-grained control over testing, or wish to extend doctest’s
capabilities, then you should use the advanced API.

The advanced API revolves around two container classes, which are used to store
the interactive examples extracted from doctest cases:

- [`Example`](doctest.md#doctest.Example "doctest.Example"): A single Python [statement](https://docs.python.org/3.10/glossary.html#term-statement), paired with its expected
  output.
- [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest"): A collection of [`Example`](doctest.md#doctest.Example "doctest.Example")s, typically extracted
  from a single docstring or text file.

Additional processing classes are defined to find, parse, and run, and check
doctest examples:

- [`DocTestFinder`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestFinder "doctest.DocTestFinder"): Finds all docstrings in a given module, and uses a
  [`DocTestParser`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestParser "doctest.DocTestParser") to create a [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") from every docstring that
  contains interactive examples.
- [`DocTestParser`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestParser "doctest.DocTestParser"): Creates a [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") object from a string (such
  as an object’s docstring).
- [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner"): Executes the examples in a [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest"), and uses
  an [`OutputChecker`](doctest.md#doctest.OutputChecker "doctest.OutputChecker") to verify their output.
- [`OutputChecker`](doctest.md#doctest.OutputChecker "doctest.OutputChecker"): Compares the actual output from a doctest example with
  the expected output, and decides whether they match.

The relationships among these processing classes are summarized in the following
diagram:

```python3
                            list of:
+------+                   +---------+
|module| --DocTestFinder-> | DocTest | --DocTestRunner-> results
+------+    |        ^     +---------+     |       ^    (printed)
            |        |     | Example |     |       |
            v        |     |   ...   |     v       |
           DocTestParser   | Example |   OutputChecker
                           +---------+
```

### DocTest Objects

`class doctest.DocTest(examples, globs, name, filename, lineno, docstring)`
:   A collection of doctest examples that should be run in a single namespace. The
    constructor arguments are used to initialize the attributes of the same names.

    [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") defines the following attributes. They are initialized by
    the constructor, and should not be modified directly.

    `examples`
    :   A list of [`Example`](doctest.md#doctest.Example "doctest.Example") objects encoding the individual interactive Python
        examples that should be run by this test.

    `globs`
    :   The namespace (aka globals) that the examples should be run in. This is a
        dictionary mapping names to values. Any changes to the namespace made by the
        examples (such as binding new variables) will be reflected in [`globs`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest.globs "doctest.DocTest.globs")
        after the test is run.

    `name`
    :   A string name identifying the [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest"). Typically, this is the name
        of the object or file that the test was extracted from.

    `filename`
    :   The name of the file that this [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") was extracted from; or
        `None` if the filename is unknown, or if the [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") was not
        extracted from a file.

    `lineno`
    :   The line number within [`filename`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest.filename "doctest.DocTest.filename") where this [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") begins, or
        `None` if the line number is unavailable. This line number is zero-based
        with respect to the beginning of the file.

    `docstring`
    :   The string that the test was extracted from, or `None` if the string is
        unavailable, or if the test was not extracted from a string.

### Example Objects

`class doctest.Example(source, want, exc_msg=None, lineno=0, indent=0, options=None)`
:   A single interactive example, consisting of a Python statement and its expected
    output. The constructor arguments are used to initialize the attributes of
    the same names.

    [`Example`](doctest.md#doctest.Example "doctest.Example") defines the following attributes. They are initialized by
    the constructor, and should not be modified directly.

    `source`
    :   A string containing the example’s source code. This source code consists of a
        single Python statement, and always ends with a newline; the constructor adds
        a newline when necessary.

    `want`
    :   The expected output from running the example’s source code (either from
        stdout, or a traceback in case of exception). [`want`](doctest.md#doctest.Example.want "doctest.Example.want") ends with a
        newline unless no output is expected, in which case it’s an empty string. The
        constructor adds a newline when necessary.

    `exc_msg`
    :   The exception message generated by the example, if the example is expected to
        generate an exception; or `None` if it is not expected to generate an
        exception. This exception message is compared against the return value of
        [`traceback.format_exception_only()`](traceback.md#traceback.format_exception_only "traceback.format_exception_only"). [`exc_msg`](doctest.md#doctest.Example.exc_msg "doctest.Example.exc_msg") ends with a newline
        unless it’s `None`. The constructor adds a newline if needed.

    `lineno`
    :   The line number within the string containing this example where the example
        begins. This line number is zero-based with respect to the beginning of the
        containing string.

    `indent`
    :   The example’s indentation in the containing string, i.e., the number of space
        characters that precede the example’s first prompt.

    `options`
    :   A dictionary mapping from option flags to `True` or `False`, which is used
        to override default options for this example. Any option flags not contained
        in this dictionary are left at their default value (as specified by the
        [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner")’s `optionflags`). By default, no options are set.

### DocTestFinder objects

`class doctest.DocTestFinder(verbose=False, parser=DocTestParser(), recurse=True, exclude_empty=True)`
:   A processing class used to extract the [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest")s that are relevant to
    a given object, from its docstring and the docstrings of its contained objects.
    [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest")s can be extracted from modules, classes, functions,
    methods, staticmethods, classmethods, and properties.

    The optional argument *verbose* can be used to display the objects searched by
    the finder. It defaults to `False` (no output).

    The optional argument *parser* specifies the [`DocTestParser`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestParser "doctest.DocTestParser") object (or a
    drop-in replacement) that is used to extract doctests from docstrings.

    If the optional argument *recurse* is false, then [`DocTestFinder.find()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestFinder.find "doctest.DocTestFinder.find")
    will only examine the given object, and not any contained objects.

    If the optional argument *exclude_empty* is false, then
    [`DocTestFinder.find()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestFinder.find "doctest.DocTestFinder.find") will include tests for objects with empty docstrings.

    [`DocTestFinder`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestFinder "doctest.DocTestFinder") defines the following method:

    `find(obj[, name][, module][, globs][, extraglobs])`
    :   Return a list of the [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest")s that are defined by *obj*’s
        docstring, or by any of its contained objects’ docstrings.

        The optional argument *name* specifies the object’s name; this name will be
        used to construct names for the returned [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest")s. If *name* is
        not specified, then `obj.__name__` is used.

        The optional parameter *module* is the module that contains the given object.
        If the module is not specified or is `None`, then the test finder will attempt
        to automatically determine the correct module. The object’s module is used:

        - As a default namespace, if *globs* is not specified.
        - To prevent the DocTestFinder from extracting DocTests from objects that are
          imported from other modules. (Contained objects with modules other than
          *module* are ignored.)
        - To find the name of the file containing the object.
        - To help find the line number of the object within its file.

        If *module* is `False`, no attempt to find the module will be made. This is
        obscure, of use mostly in testing doctest itself: if *module* is `False`, or
        is `None` but cannot be found automatically, then all objects are considered
        to belong to the (non-existent) module, so all contained objects will
        (recursively) be searched for doctests.

        The globals for each [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") is formed by combining *globs* and
        *extraglobs* (bindings in *extraglobs* override bindings in *globs*). A new
        shallow copy of the globals dictionary is created for each [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest").
        If *globs* is not specified, then it defaults to the module’s *__dict__*, if
        specified, or `{}` otherwise. If *extraglobs* is not specified, then it
        defaults to `{}`.

### DocTestParser objects

`class doctest.DocTestParser`
:   A processing class used to extract interactive examples from a string, and use
    them to create a [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") object.

    [`DocTestParser`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestParser "doctest.DocTestParser") defines the following methods:

    `get_doctest(string, globs, name, filename, lineno)`
    :   Extract all doctest examples from the given string, and collect them into a
        [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") object.

        *globs*, *name*, *filename*, and *lineno* are attributes for the new
        [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") object. See the documentation for [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") for more
        information.

    `get_examples(string, name='<string>')`
    :   Extract all doctest examples from the given string, and return them as a list
        of [`Example`](doctest.md#doctest.Example "doctest.Example") objects. Line numbers are 0-based. The optional argument
        *name* is a name identifying this string, and is only used for error messages.

    `parse(string, name='<string>')`
    :   Divide the given string into examples and intervening text, and return them as
        a list of alternating [`Example`](doctest.md#doctest.Example "doctest.Example")s and strings. Line numbers for the
        [`Example`](doctest.md#doctest.Example "doctest.Example")s are 0-based. The optional argument *name* is a name
        identifying this string, and is only used for error messages.

### DocTestRunner objects

`class doctest.DocTestRunner(checker=None, verbose=None, optionflags=0)`
:   A processing class used to execute and verify the interactive examples in a
    [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest").

    The comparison between expected outputs and actual outputs is done by an
    [`OutputChecker`](doctest.md#doctest.OutputChecker "doctest.OutputChecker"). This comparison may be customized with a number of
    option flags; see section [Option Flags](doctest.md#doctest-options) for more information. If the
    option flags are insufficient, then the comparison may also be customized by
    passing a subclass of [`OutputChecker`](doctest.md#doctest.OutputChecker "doctest.OutputChecker") to the constructor.

    The test runner’s display output can be controlled in two ways. First, an output
    function can be passed to `TestRunner.run()`; this function will be called
    with strings that should be displayed. It defaults to `sys.stdout.write`. If
    capturing the output is not sufficient, then the display output can be also
    customized by subclassing DocTestRunner, and overriding the methods
    [`report_start()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner.report_start "doctest.DocTestRunner.report_start"), [`report_success()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner.report_success "doctest.DocTestRunner.report_success"),
    [`report_unexpected_exception()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner.report_unexpected_exception "doctest.DocTestRunner.report_unexpected_exception"), and [`report_failure()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner.report_failure "doctest.DocTestRunner.report_failure").

    The optional keyword argument *checker* specifies the [`OutputChecker`](doctest.md#doctest.OutputChecker "doctest.OutputChecker")
    object (or drop-in replacement) that should be used to compare the expected
    outputs to the actual outputs of doctest examples.

    The optional keyword argument *verbose* controls the [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner")’s
    verbosity. If *verbose* is `True`, then information is printed about each
    example, as it is run. If *verbose* is `False`, then only failures are
    printed. If *verbose* is unspecified, or `None`, then verbose output is used
    iff the command-line switch `-v` is used.

    The optional keyword argument *optionflags* can be used to control how the test
    runner compares expected output to actual output, and how it displays failures.
    For more information, see section [Option Flags](doctest.md#doctest-options).

    [`DocTestParser`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestParser "doctest.DocTestParser") defines the following methods:

    `report_start(out, test, example)`
    :   Report that the test runner is about to process the given example. This method
        is provided to allow subclasses of [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner") to customize their
        output; it should not be called directly.

        *example* is the example about to be processed. *test* is the test
        *containing example*. *out* is the output function that was passed to
        [`DocTestRunner.run()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner.run "doctest.DocTestRunner.run").

    `report_success(out, test, example, got)`
    :   Report that the given example ran successfully. This method is provided to
        allow subclasses of [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner") to customize their output; it
        should not be called directly.

        *example* is the example about to be processed. *got* is the actual output
        from the example. *test* is the test containing *example*. *out* is the
        output function that was passed to [`DocTestRunner.run()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner.run "doctest.DocTestRunner.run").

    `report_failure(out, test, example, got)`
    :   Report that the given example failed. This method is provided to allow
        subclasses of [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner") to customize their output; it should not
        be called directly.

        *example* is the example about to be processed. *got* is the actual output
        from the example. *test* is the test containing *example*. *out* is the
        output function that was passed to [`DocTestRunner.run()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner.run "doctest.DocTestRunner.run").

    `report_unexpected_exception(out, test, example, exc_info)`
    :   Report that the given example raised an unexpected exception. This method is
        provided to allow subclasses of [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner") to customize their
        output; it should not be called directly.

        *example* is the example about to be processed. *exc_info* is a tuple
        containing information about the unexpected exception (as returned by
        [`sys.exc_info()`](sys.md#sys.exc_info "sys.exc_info")). *test* is the test containing *example*. *out* is the
        output function that was passed to [`DocTestRunner.run()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner.run "doctest.DocTestRunner.run").

    `run(test, compileflags=None, out=None, clear_globs=True)`
    :   Run the examples in *test* (a [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") object), and display the
        results using the writer function *out*.

        The examples are run in the namespace `test.globs`. If *clear_globs* is
        true (the default), then this namespace will be cleared after the test runs,
        to help with garbage collection. If you would like to examine the namespace
        after the test completes, then use *clear_globs=False*.

        *compileflags* gives the set of flags that should be used by the Python
        compiler when running the examples. If not specified, then it will default to
        the set of future-import flags that apply to *globs*.

        The output of each example is checked using the [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner")’s
        output checker, and the results are formatted by the
        `DocTestRunner.report_*()` methods.

    `summarize(verbose=None)`
    :   Print a summary of all the test cases that have been run by this DocTestRunner,
        and return a [named tuple](https://docs.python.org/3.10/glossary.html#term-named-tuple) `TestResults(failed, attempted)`.

        The optional *verbose* argument controls how detailed the summary is. If the
        verbosity is not specified, then the [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner")’s verbosity is
        used.

### OutputChecker objects

`class doctest.OutputChecker`
:   A class used to check the whether the actual output from a doctest example
    matches the expected output. [`OutputChecker`](doctest.md#doctest.OutputChecker "doctest.OutputChecker") defines two methods:
    [`check_output()`](doctest.md#doctest.OutputChecker.check_output "doctest.OutputChecker.check_output"), which compares a given pair of outputs, and returns `True`
    if they match; and [`output_difference()`](doctest.md#doctest.OutputChecker.output_difference "doctest.OutputChecker.output_difference"), which returns a string describing
    the differences between two outputs.

    [`OutputChecker`](doctest.md#doctest.OutputChecker "doctest.OutputChecker") defines the following methods:

    `check_output(want, got, optionflags)`
    :   Return `True` iff the actual output from an example (*got*) matches the
        expected output (*want*). These strings are always considered to match if
        they are identical; but depending on what option flags the test runner is
        using, several non-exact match types are also possible. See section
        [Option Flags](doctest.md#doctest-options) for more information about option flags.

    `output_difference(example, got, optionflags)`
    :   Return a string describing the differences between the expected output for a
        given example (*example*) and the actual output (*got*). *optionflags* is the
        set of option flags used to compare *want* and *got*.

## Debugging

Doctest provides several mechanisms for debugging doctest examples:

- Several functions convert doctests to executable Python programs, which can be
  run under the Python debugger, [`pdb`](pdb.md#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.").
- The [`DebugRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DebugRunner "doctest.DebugRunner") class is a subclass of [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner") that
  raises an exception for the first failing example, containing information about
  that example. This information can be used to perform post-mortem debugging on
  the example.
- The [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") cases generated by [`DocTestSuite()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestSuite "doctest.DocTestSuite") support the
  [`debug()`](doctest.md#doctest.debug "doctest.debug") method defined by [`unittest.TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase").
- You can add a call to [`pdb.set_trace()`](pdb.md#pdb.set_trace "pdb.set_trace") in a doctest example, and you’ll
  drop into the Python debugger when that line is executed. Then you can inspect
  current values of variables, and so on. For example, suppose `a.py`
  contains just this module docstring:

  ```python3
  """
  >>> def f(x):
  ...     g(x*2)
  >>> def g(x):
  ...     print(x+3)
  ...     import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
  >>> f(3)
  9
  """
  ```

  Then an interactive Python session may look like this:

  ```python3
  >>> import a, doctest
  >>> doctest.testmod(a)
  --Return--
  > <doctest a[1]>(3)g()->None
  -> import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
  (Pdb) list
    1     def g(x):
    2         print(x+3)
    3  ->     import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
  [EOF]
  (Pdb) p x
  6
  (Pdb) step
  --Return--
  > <doctest a[0]>(2)f()->None
  -> g(x*2)
  (Pdb) list
    1     def f(x):
    2  ->     g(x*2)
  [EOF]
  (Pdb) p x
  3
  (Pdb) step
  --Return--
  > <doctest a[2]>(1)?()->None
  -> f(3)
  (Pdb) cont
  (0, 3)
  >>>
  ```

Functions that convert doctests to Python code, and possibly run the synthesized
code under the debugger:

`doctest.script_from_examples(s)`
:   Convert text with examples to a script.

    Argument *s* is a string containing doctest examples. The string is converted
    to a Python script, where doctest examples in *s* are converted to regular code,
    and everything else is converted to Python comments. The generated script is
    returned as a string. For example,

    ```python3
    import doctest
    print(doctest.script_from_examples(r"""
        Set x and y to 1 and 2.
        >>> x, y = 1, 2

        Print their sum:
        >>> print(x+y)
        3
    """))
    ```

    displays:

    ```python3
    # Set x and y to 1 and 2.
    x, y = 1, 2
    #
    # Print their sum:
    print(x+y)
    # Expected:
    ## 3
    ```

    This function is used internally by other functions (see below), but can also be
    useful when you want to transform an interactive Python session into a Python
    script.

`doctest.testsource(module, name)`
:   Convert the doctest for an object to a script.

    Argument *module* is a module object, or dotted name of a module, containing the
    object whose doctests are of interest. Argument *name* is the name (within the
    module) of the object with the doctests of interest. The result is a string,
    containing the object’s docstring converted to a Python script, as described for
    [`script_from_examples()`](doctest.md#doctest.script_from_examples "doctest.script_from_examples") above. For example, if module `a.py`
    contains a top-level function `f()`, then

    ```python3
    import a, doctest
    print(doctest.testsource(a, "a.f"))
    ```

    prints a script version of function `f()`’s docstring, with doctests
    converted to code, and the rest placed in comments.

`doctest.debug(module, name, pm=False)`
:   Debug the doctests for an object.

    The *module* and *name* arguments are the same as for function
    [`testsource()`](doctest.md#doctest.testsource "doctest.testsource") above. The synthesized Python script for the named object’s
    docstring is written to a temporary file, and then that file is run under the
    control of the Python debugger, [`pdb`](pdb.md#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.").

    A shallow copy of `module.__dict__` is used for both local and global
    execution context.

    Optional argument *pm* controls whether post-mortem debugging is used. If *pm*
    has a true value, the script file is run directly, and the debugger gets
    involved only if the script terminates via raising an unhandled exception. If
    it does, then post-mortem debugging is invoked, via [`pdb.post_mortem()`](pdb.md#pdb.post_mortem "pdb.post_mortem"),
    passing the traceback object from the unhandled exception. If *pm* is not
    specified, or is false, the script is run under the debugger from the start, via
    passing an appropriate [`exec()`](functions.md#exec "exec") call to [`pdb.run()`](pdb.md#pdb.run "pdb.run").

`doctest.debug_src(src, pm=False, globs=None)`
:   Debug the doctests in a string.

    This is like function [`debug()`](doctest.md#doctest.debug "doctest.debug") above, except that a string containing
    doctest examples is specified directly, via the *src* argument.

    Optional argument *pm* has the same meaning as in function [`debug()`](doctest.md#doctest.debug "doctest.debug") above.

    Optional argument *globs* gives a dictionary to use as both local and global
    execution context. If not specified, or `None`, an empty dictionary is used.
    If specified, a shallow copy of the dictionary is used.

The [`DebugRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DebugRunner "doctest.DebugRunner") class, and the special exceptions it may raise, are of
most interest to testing framework authors, and will only be sketched here. See
the source code, and especially [`DebugRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DebugRunner "doctest.DebugRunner")’s docstring (which is a
doctest!) for more details:

`class doctest.DebugRunner(checker=None, verbose=None, optionflags=0)`
:   A subclass of [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner") that raises an exception as soon as a
    failure is encountered. If an unexpected exception occurs, an
    [`UnexpectedException`](doctest.md#doctest.UnexpectedException "doctest.UnexpectedException") exception is raised, containing the test, the
    example, and the original exception. If the output doesn’t match, then a
    [`DocTestFailure`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestFailure "doctest.DocTestFailure") exception is raised, containing the test, the example, and
    the actual output.

    For information about the constructor parameters and methods, see the
    documentation for [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner") in section [Advanced API](doctest.md#doctest-advanced-api).

There are two exceptions that may be raised by [`DebugRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DebugRunner "doctest.DebugRunner") instances:

`exception doctest.DocTestFailure(test, example, got)`
:   An exception raised by [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner") to signal that a doctest example’s
    actual output did not match its expected output. The constructor arguments are
    used to initialize the attributes of the same names.

[`DocTestFailure`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestFailure "doctest.DocTestFailure") defines the following attributes:

`DocTestFailure.test`
:   The [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") object that was being run when the example failed.

`DocTestFailure.example`
:   The [`Example`](doctest.md#doctest.Example "doctest.Example") that failed.

`DocTestFailure.got`
:   The example’s actual output.

`exception doctest.UnexpectedException(test, example, exc_info)`
:   An exception raised by [`DocTestRunner`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTestRunner "doctest.DocTestRunner") to signal that a doctest
    example raised an unexpected exception. The constructor arguments are used
    to initialize the attributes of the same names.

[`UnexpectedException`](doctest.md#doctest.UnexpectedException "doctest.UnexpectedException") defines the following attributes:

`UnexpectedException.test`
:   The [`DocTest`](doctest.md#doctest.DocTest "doctest.DocTest") object that was being run when the example failed.

`UnexpectedException.example`
:   The [`Example`](doctest.md#doctest.Example "doctest.Example") that failed.

`UnexpectedException.exc_info`
:   A tuple containing information about the unexpected exception, as returned by
    [`sys.exc_info()`](sys.md#sys.exc_info "sys.exc_info").

## Soapbox

As mentioned in the introduction, [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") has grown to have three primary
uses:

1. Checking examples in docstrings.
2. Regression testing.
3. Executable documentation / literate testing.

These uses have different requirements, and it is important to distinguish them.
In particular, filling your docstrings with obscure test cases makes for bad
documentation.

When writing a docstring, choose docstring examples with care. There’s an art to
this that needs to be learned—it may not be natural at first. Examples should
add genuine value to the documentation. A good example can often be worth many
words. If done with care, the examples will be invaluable for your users, and
will pay back the time it takes to collect them many times over as the years go
by and things change. I’m still amazed at how often one of my [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.")
examples stops working after a “harmless” change.

Doctest also makes an excellent tool for regression testing, especially if you
don’t skimp on explanatory text. By interleaving prose and examples, it becomes
much easier to keep track of what’s actually being tested, and why. When a test
fails, good prose can make it much easier to figure out what the problem is, and
how it should be fixed. It’s true that you could write extensive comments in
code-based testing, but few programmers do. Many have found that using doctest
approaches instead leads to much clearer tests. Perhaps this is simply because
doctest makes writing prose a little easier than writing code, while writing
comments in code is a little harder. I think it goes deeper than just that:
the natural attitude when writing a doctest-based test is that you want to
explain the fine points of your software, and illustrate them with examples.
This in turn naturally leads to test files that start with the simplest
features, and logically progress to complications and edge cases. A coherent
narrative is the result, instead of a collection of isolated functions that test
isolated bits of functionality seemingly at random. It’s a different attitude,
and produces different results, blurring the distinction between testing and
explaining.

Regression testing is best confined to dedicated objects or files. There are
several options for organizing tests:

- Write text files containing test cases as interactive examples, and test the
  files using [`testfile()`](doctest.md#doctest.testfile "doctest.testfile") or [`DocFileSuite()`](doctest.md#doctest.DocFileSuite "doctest.DocFileSuite"). This is recommended,
  although is easiest to do for new projects, designed from the start to use
  doctest.
- Define functions named `_regrtest_topic` that consist of single docstrings,
  containing test cases for the named topics. These functions can be included in
  the same file as the module, or separated out into a separate test file.
- Define a `__test__` dictionary mapping from regression test topics to
  docstrings containing test cases.

When you have placed your tests in a module, the module can itself be the test
runner. When a test fails, you can arrange for your test runner to re-run only
the failing doctest while you debug the problem. Here is a minimal example of
such a test runner:

```python3
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import doctest
    flags = doctest.REPORT_NDIFF|doctest.FAIL_FAST
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        name = sys.argv[1]
        if name in globals():
            obj = globals()[name]
        else:
            obj = __test__[name]
        doctest.run_docstring_examples(obj, globals(), name=name,
                                       optionflags=flags)
    else:
        fail, total = doctest.testmod(optionflags=flags)
        print("{} failures out of {} tests".format(fail, total))
```

Footnotes

[1](doctest.md#id1)
:   Examples containing both expected output and an exception are not supported.
    Trying to guess where one ends and the other begins is too error-prone, and that
    also makes for a confusing test.
