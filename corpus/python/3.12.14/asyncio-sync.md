# Synchronization Primitives

**Source code:** [Lib/asyncio/locks.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/asyncio/locks.py)

---

asyncio synchronization primitives are designed to be similar to
those of the [`threading`](threading.md#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.") module with two important caveats:

- asyncio primitives are not thread-safe, therefore they should not
  be used for OS thread synchronization (use [`threading`](threading.md#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.") for
  that);
- methods of these synchronization primitives do not accept the *timeout*
  argument; use the [`asyncio.wait_for()`](asyncio-task.md#asyncio.wait_for "asyncio.wait_for") function to perform
  operations with timeouts.

asyncio has the following basic synchronization primitives:

- [`Lock`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Lock "asyncio.Lock")
- [`Event`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Event "asyncio.Event")
- [`Condition`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Condition "asyncio.Condition")
- [`Semaphore`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Semaphore "asyncio.Semaphore")
- [`BoundedSemaphore`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.BoundedSemaphore "asyncio.BoundedSemaphore")
- [`Barrier`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Barrier "asyncio.Barrier")

---

## Lock

*class* asyncio.Lock
:   Implements a mutex lock for asyncio tasks. Not thread-safe.

    An asyncio lock can be used to guarantee exclusive access to a
    shared resource.

    The preferred way to use a Lock is an [`async with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-with)
    statement:

    ```python3
    lock = asyncio.Lock()

    # ... later
    async with lock:
        # access shared state
    ```

    which is equivalent to:

    ```python3
    lock = asyncio.Lock()

    # ... later
    await lock.acquire()
    try:
        # access shared state
    finally:
        lock.release()
    ```

    Changed in version 3.10: Removed the *loop* parameter.

    *async* acquire()
    :   Acquire the lock.

        This method waits until the lock is *unlocked*, sets it to
        *locked* and returns `True`.

        When more than one coroutine is blocked in [`acquire()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Lock.acquire "asyncio.Lock.acquire")
        waiting for the lock to be unlocked, only one coroutine
        eventually proceeds.

        Acquiring a lock is *fair*: the coroutine that proceeds will be
        the first coroutine that started waiting on the lock.

    release()
    :   Release the lock.

        When the lock is *locked*, reset it to *unlocked* and return.

        If the lock is *unlocked*, a [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") is raised.

    locked()
    :   Return `True` if the lock is *locked*.

## Event

*class* asyncio.Event
:   An event object. Not thread-safe.

    An asyncio event can be used to notify multiple asyncio tasks
    that some event has happened.

    An Event object manages an internal flag that can be set to *true*
    with the [`set()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Event.set "asyncio.Event.set") method and reset to *false* with the
    [`clear()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Event.clear "asyncio.Event.clear") method. The [`wait()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Event.wait "asyncio.Event.wait") method blocks until the
    flag is set to *true*. The flag is set to *false* initially.

    Changed in version 3.10: Removed the *loop* parameter.

    Example:

    ```python3
    async def waiter(event):
        print('waiting for it ...')
        await event.wait()
        print('... got it!')

    async def main():
        # Create an Event object.
        event = asyncio.Event()

        # Spawn a Task to wait until 'event' is set.
        waiter_task = asyncio.create_task(waiter(event))

        # Sleep for 1 second and set the event.
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        event.set()

        # Wait until the waiter task is finished.
        await waiter_task

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    *async* wait()
    :   Wait until the event is set.

        If the event is set, return `True` immediately.
        Otherwise block until another task calls [`set()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Event.set "asyncio.Event.set").

    set()
    :   Set the event.

        All tasks waiting for event to be set will be immediately
        awakened.

    clear()
    :   Clear (unset) the event.

        Tasks awaiting on [`wait()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Event.wait "asyncio.Event.wait") will now block until the
        [`set()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Event.set "asyncio.Event.set") method is called again.

    is_set()
    :   Return `True` if the event is set.

## Condition

*class* asyncio.Condition(*lock=None*)
:   A Condition object. Not thread-safe.

    An asyncio condition primitive can be used by a task to wait for
    some event to happen and then get exclusive access to a shared
    resource.

    In essence, a Condition object combines the functionality
    of an [`Event`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Event "asyncio.Event") and a [`Lock`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Lock "asyncio.Lock"). It is possible to have
    multiple Condition objects share one Lock, which allows coordinating
    exclusive access to a shared resource between different tasks
    interested in particular states of that shared resource.

    The optional *lock* argument must be a [`Lock`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Lock "asyncio.Lock") object or
    `None`. In the latter case a new Lock object is created
    automatically.

    Changed in version 3.10: Removed the *loop* parameter.

    The preferred way to use a Condition is an [`async with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-with)
    statement:

    ```python3
    cond = asyncio.Condition()

    # ... later
    async with cond:
        await cond.wait()
    ```

    which is equivalent to:

    ```python3
    cond = asyncio.Condition()

    # ... later
    await cond.acquire()
    try:
        await cond.wait()
    finally:
        cond.release()
    ```

    *async* acquire()
    :   Acquire the underlying lock.

        This method waits until the underlying lock is *unlocked*,
        sets it to *locked* and returns `True`.

    notify(*n=1*)
    :   Wake up at most *n* tasks (1 by default) waiting on this
        condition. The method is no-op if no tasks are waiting.

        The lock must be acquired before this method is called and
        released shortly after. If called with an *unlocked* lock
        a [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") error is raised.

    locked()
    :   Return `True` if the underlying lock is acquired.

    notify_all()
    :   Wake up all tasks waiting on this condition.

        This method acts like [`notify()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Condition.notify "asyncio.Condition.notify"), but wakes up all waiting
        tasks.

        The lock must be acquired before this method is called and
        released shortly after. If called with an *unlocked* lock
        a [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") error is raised.

    release()
    :   Release the underlying lock.

        When invoked on an unlocked lock, a [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") is
        raised.

    *async* wait()
    :   Wait until notified.

        If the calling task has not acquired the lock when this method is
        called, a [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") is raised.

        This method releases the underlying lock, and then blocks until
        it is awakened by a [`notify()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Condition.notify "asyncio.Condition.notify") or [`notify_all()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Condition.notify_all "asyncio.Condition.notify_all") call.
        Once awakened, the Condition re-acquires its lock and this method
        returns `True`.

    *async* wait_for(*predicate*)
    :   Wait until a predicate becomes *true*.

        The predicate must be a callable which result will be
        interpreted as a boolean value. The method will repeatedly
        [`wait()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Condition.wait "asyncio.Condition.wait") until the predicate evaluates to *true*.
        The final value is the return value.

## Semaphore

*class* asyncio.Semaphore(*value=1*)
:   A Semaphore object. Not thread-safe.

    A semaphore manages an internal counter which is decremented by each
    [`acquire()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Semaphore.acquire "asyncio.Semaphore.acquire") call and incremented by each [`release()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Semaphore.release "asyncio.Semaphore.release") call.
    The counter can never go below zero; when [`acquire()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Semaphore.acquire "asyncio.Semaphore.acquire") finds
    that it is zero, it blocks, waiting until some task calls
    [`release()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Semaphore.release "asyncio.Semaphore.release").

    The optional *value* argument gives the initial value for the
    internal counter (`1` by default). If the given value is
    less than `0` a [`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError "ValueError") is raised.

    Changed in version 3.10: Removed the *loop* parameter.

    The preferred way to use a Semaphore is an [`async with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-with)
    statement:

    ```python3
    sem = asyncio.Semaphore(10)

    # ... later
    async with sem:
        # work with shared resource
    ```

    which is equivalent to:

    ```python3
    sem = asyncio.Semaphore(10)

    # ... later
    await sem.acquire()
    try:
        # work with shared resource
    finally:
        sem.release()
    ```

    *async* acquire()
    :   Acquire a semaphore.

        If the internal counter is greater than zero, decrement
        it by one and return `True` immediately. If it is zero, wait
        until a [`release()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Semaphore.release "asyncio.Semaphore.release") is called and return `True`.

    locked()
    :   Returns `True` if semaphore can not be acquired immediately.

    release()
    :   Release a semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by one.
        Can wake up a task waiting to acquire the semaphore.

        Unlike [`BoundedSemaphore`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.BoundedSemaphore "asyncio.BoundedSemaphore"), [`Semaphore`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Semaphore "asyncio.Semaphore") allows
        making more `release()` calls than `acquire()` calls.

## BoundedSemaphore

*class* asyncio.BoundedSemaphore(*value=1*)
:   A bounded semaphore object. Not thread-safe.

    Bounded Semaphore is a version of [`Semaphore`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Semaphore "asyncio.Semaphore") that raises
    a [`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError "ValueError") in [`release()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Semaphore.release "asyncio.Semaphore.release") if it
    increases the internal counter above the initial *value*.

    Changed in version 3.10: Removed the *loop* parameter.

## Barrier

*class* asyncio.Barrier(*parties*)
:   A barrier object. Not thread-safe.

    A barrier is a simple synchronization primitive that allows to block until
    *parties* number of tasks are waiting on it.
    Tasks can wait on the [`wait()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Barrier.wait "asyncio.Barrier.wait") method and would be blocked until
    the specified number of tasks end up waiting on [`wait()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Barrier.wait "asyncio.Barrier.wait").
    At that point all of the waiting tasks would unblock simultaneously.

    [`async with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-with) can be used as an alternative to awaiting on
    [`wait()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Barrier.wait "asyncio.Barrier.wait").

    The barrier can be reused any number of times.

    Example:

    ```python3
    async def example_barrier():
       # barrier with 3 parties
       b = asyncio.Barrier(3)

       # create 2 new waiting tasks
       asyncio.create_task(b.wait())
       asyncio.create_task(b.wait())

       await asyncio.sleep(0)
       print(b)

       # The third .wait() call passes the barrier
       await b.wait()
       print(b)
       print("barrier passed")

       await asyncio.sleep(0)
       print(b)

    asyncio.run(example_barrier())
    ```

    Result of this example is:

    ```python3
    <asyncio.locks.Barrier object at 0x... [filling, waiters:2/3]>
    <asyncio.locks.Barrier object at 0x... [draining, waiters:0/3]>
    barrier passed
    <asyncio.locks.Barrier object at 0x... [filling, waiters:0/3]>
    ```

    Added in version 3.11.

    *async* wait()
    :   Pass the barrier. When all the tasks party to the barrier have called
        this function, they are all unblocked simultaneously.

        When a waiting or blocked task in the barrier is cancelled,
        this task exits the barrier which stays in the same state.
        If the state of the barrier is “filling”, the number of waiting task
        decreases by 1.

        The return value is an integer in the range of 0 to `parties-1`, different
        for each task. This can be used to select a task to do some special
        housekeeping, e.g.:

        ```python3
        ...
        async with barrier as position:
           if position == 0:
              # Only one task prints this
              print('End of *draining phase*')
        ```

        This method may raise a [`BrokenBarrierError`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.BrokenBarrierError "asyncio.BrokenBarrierError") exception if the
        barrier is broken or reset while a task is waiting.
        It could raise a [`CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.md#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") if a task is cancelled.

    *async* reset()
    :   Return the barrier to the default, empty state. Any tasks waiting on it
        will receive the [`BrokenBarrierError`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.BrokenBarrierError "asyncio.BrokenBarrierError") exception.

        If a barrier is broken it may be better to just leave it and create a new one.

    *async* abort()
    :   Put the barrier into a broken state. This causes any active or future
        calls to [`wait()`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Barrier.wait "asyncio.Barrier.wait") to fail with the [`BrokenBarrierError`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.BrokenBarrierError "asyncio.BrokenBarrierError").
        Use this for example if one of the tasks needs to abort, to avoid infinite
        waiting tasks.

    parties
    :   The number of tasks required to pass the barrier.

    n_waiting
    :   The number of tasks currently waiting in the barrier while filling.

    broken
    :   A boolean that is `True` if the barrier is in the broken state.

*exception* asyncio.BrokenBarrierError
:   This exception, a subclass of [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError"), is raised when the
    [`Barrier`](asyncio-sync.md#asyncio.Barrier "asyncio.Barrier") object is reset or broken.

Changed in version 3.9: Acquiring a lock using `await lock` or `yield from lock` and/or
[`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement (`with await lock`, `with (yield from
lock)`) was removed. Use `async with lock` instead.
