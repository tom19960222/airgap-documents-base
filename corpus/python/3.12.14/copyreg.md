# `copyreg` — Register `pickle` support functions

**Source code:** [Lib/copyreg.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/copyreg.py)

---

The [`copyreg`](copyreg.md#module-copyreg "copyreg: Register pickle support functions.") module offers a way to define functions used while pickling
specific objects. The [`pickle`](pickle.md#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.") and [`copy`](copy.md#module-copy "copy: Shallow and deep copy operations.") modules use those functions
when pickling/copying those objects. The module provides configuration
information about object constructors which are not classes.
Such constructors may be factory functions or class instances.

copyreg.constructor(*object*)
:   Declares *object* to be a valid constructor. If *object* is not callable (and
    hence not valid as a constructor), raises [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError "TypeError").

copyreg.pickle(*type*, *function*, *constructor_ob=None*)
:   Declares that *function* should be used as a “reduction” function for objects
    of type *type*. *function* must return either a string or a tuple
    containing between two and six elements. See the [`dispatch_table`](pickle.md#pickle.Pickler.dispatch_table "pickle.Pickler.dispatch_table")
    for more details on the interface of *function*.

    The *constructor_ob* parameter is a legacy feature and is now ignored, but if
    passed it must be a callable.

    Note that the [`dispatch_table`](pickle.md#pickle.Pickler.dispatch_table "pickle.Pickler.dispatch_table") attribute of a pickler
    object or subclass of [`pickle.Pickler`](pickle.md#pickle.Pickler "pickle.Pickler") can also be used for
    declaring reduction functions.

## Example

The example below would like to show how to register a pickle function and how
it will be used:

```
>>> import copyreg, copy, pickle
>>> class C:
...     def __init__(self, a):
...         self.a = a
...
>>> def pickle_c(c):
...     print("pickling a C instance...")
...     return C, (c.a,)
...
>>> copyreg.pickle(C, pickle_c)
>>> c = C(1)
>>> d = copy.copy(c)
pickling a C instance...
>>> p = pickle.dumps(c)
pickling a C instance...
```
