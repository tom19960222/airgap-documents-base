# `unittest` — Unit testing framework

**Source code:** [Lib/unittest/__init__.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/unittest/__init__.py)

---

(If you are already familiar with the basic concepts of testing, you might want
to skip to [the list of assert methods](unittest.md#assert-methods).)

The [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") unit testing framework was originally inspired by JUnit
and has a similar flavor as major unit testing frameworks in other
languages. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code
for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the
tests from the reporting framework.

To achieve this, [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") supports some important concepts in an
object-oriented way:

test fixture
:   A *test fixture* represents the preparation needed to perform one or more
    tests, and any associated cleanup actions. This may involve, for example,
    creating temporary or proxy databases, directories, or starting a server
    process.

test case
:   A *test case* is the individual unit of testing. It checks for a specific
    response to a particular set of inputs. [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") provides a base class,
    [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase"), which may be used to create new test cases.

test suite
:   A *test suite* is a collection of test cases, test suites, or both. It is
    used to aggregate tests that should be executed together.

test runner
:   A *test runner* is a component which orchestrates the execution of tests
    and provides the outcome to the user. The runner may use a graphical interface,
    a textual interface, or return a special value to indicate the results of
    executing the tests.

## Basic example

The [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") module provides a rich set of tools for constructing and
running tests. This section demonstrates that a small subset of the tools
suffice to meet the needs of most users.

Here is a short script to test three string methods:

```python3
import unittest

class TestStringMethods(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_upper(self):
        self.assertEqual('foo'.upper(), 'FOO')

    def test_isupper(self):
        self.assertTrue('FOO'.isupper())
        self.assertFalse('Foo'.isupper())

    def test_split(self):
        s = 'hello world'
        self.assertEqual(s.split(), ['hello', 'world'])
        # check that s.split fails when the separator is not a string
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            s.split(2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

A testcase is created by subclassing [`unittest.TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase"). The three
individual tests are defined with methods whose names start with the letters
`test`. This naming convention informs the test runner about which methods
represent tests.

The crux of each test is a call to [`assertEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertEqual") to check for an
expected result; [`assertTrue()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertTrue "unittest.TestCase.assertTrue") or [`assertFalse()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertFalse "unittest.TestCase.assertFalse")
to verify a condition; or [`assertRaises()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises "unittest.TestCase.assertRaises") to verify that a
specific exception gets raised. These methods are used instead of the
[`assert`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/simple_stmts.html#assert) statement so the test runner can accumulate all test results
and produce a report.

The [`setUp()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUp "unittest.TestCase.setUp") and [`tearDown()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.tearDown "unittest.TestCase.tearDown") methods allow you
to define instructions that will be executed before and after each test method.
They are covered in more detail in the section [Organizing test code](unittest.md#organizing-tests).

The final block shows a simple way to run the tests. [`unittest.main()`](unittest.md#unittest.main "unittest.main")
provides a command-line interface to the test script. When run from the command
line, the above script produces an output that looks like this:

```python3
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.000s

OK
```

Passing the `-v` option to your test script will instruct [`unittest.main()`](unittest.md#unittest.main "unittest.main")
to enable a higher level of verbosity, and produce the following output:

```python3
test_isupper (__main__.TestStringMethods.test_isupper) ... ok
test_split (__main__.TestStringMethods.test_split) ... ok
test_upper (__main__.TestStringMethods.test_upper) ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.001s

OK
```

The above examples show the most commonly used [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") features which
are sufficient to meet many everyday testing needs. The remainder of the
documentation explores the full feature set from first principles.

Changed in version 3.11: The behavior of returning a value from a test method (other than the default
`None` value), is now deprecated.

## Command-Line Interface

The unittest module can be used from the command line to run tests from
modules, classes or even individual test methods:

```python3
python -m unittest test_module1 test_module2
python -m unittest test_module.TestClass
python -m unittest test_module.TestClass.test_method
```

You can pass in a list with any combination of module names, and fully
qualified class or method names.

Test modules can be specified by file path as well:

```python3
python -m unittest tests/test_something.py
```

This allows you to use the shell filename completion to specify the test module.
The file specified must still be importable as a module. The path is converted
to a module name by removing the ‘.py’ and converting path separators into ‘.’.
If you want to execute a test file that isn’t importable as a module you should
execute the file directly instead.

You can run tests with more detail (higher verbosity) by passing in the -v flag:

```python3
python -m unittest -v test_module
```

When executed without arguments [Test Discovery](unittest.md#unittest-test-discovery) is started:

```python3
python -m unittest
```

For a list of all the command-line options:

```python3
python -m unittest -h
```

Changed in version 3.2: In earlier versions it was only possible to run individual test methods and
not modules or classes.

### Command-line options

**unittest** supports these command-line options:

`-b, --buffer`
:   The standard output and standard error streams are buffered during the test
    run. Output during a passing test is discarded. Output is echoed normally
    on test fail or error and is added to the failure messages.

`-c, --catch`
:   `Control`-`C` during the test run waits for the current test to end and then
    reports all the results so far. A second `Control`-`C` raises the normal
    [`KeyboardInterrupt`](exceptions.md#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt") exception.

    See [Signal Handling](unittest.md#signal-handling) for the functions that provide this functionality.

`-f, --failfast`
:   Stop the test run on the first error or failure.

`-k`
:   Only run test methods and classes that match the pattern or substring.
    This option may be used multiple times, in which case all test cases that
    match any of the given patterns are included.

    Patterns that contain a wildcard character (`*`) are matched against the
    test name using [`fnmatch.fnmatchcase()`](fnmatch.md#fnmatch.fnmatchcase "fnmatch.fnmatchcase"); otherwise simple case-sensitive
    substring matching is used.

    Patterns are matched against the fully qualified test method name as
    imported by the test loader.

    For example, `-k foo` matches `foo_tests.SomeTest.test_something`,
    `bar_tests.SomeTest.test_foo`, but not `bar_tests.FooTest.test_something`.

`--locals`
:   Show local variables in tracebacks.

`--durations N`
:   Show the N slowest test cases (N=0 for all).

Added in version 3.2: The command-line options `-b`, `-c` and `-f` were added.

Added in version 3.5: The command-line option `--locals`.

Added in version 3.7: The command-line option `-k`.

Added in version 3.12: The command-line option `--durations`.

The command line can also be used for test discovery, for running all of the
tests in a project or just a subset.

## Test Discovery

Added in version 3.2.

Unittest supports simple test discovery. In order to be compatible with test
discovery, all of the test files must be [modules](https://docs.python.org/3.12/tutorial/modules.html#tut-modules) or
[packages](https://docs.python.org/3.12/tutorial/modules.html#tut-packages) importable from the top-level directory of
the project (this means that their filenames must be valid [identifiers](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers)).

Test discovery is implemented in [`TestLoader.discover()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader.discover "unittest.TestLoader.discover"), but can also be
used from the command line. The basic command-line usage is:

```python3
cd project_directory
python -m unittest discover
```

> **Note:**
>
> As a shortcut, `python -m unittest` is the equivalent of
> `python -m unittest discover`. If you want to pass arguments to test
> discovery the `discover` sub-command must be used explicitly.

The `discover` sub-command has the following options:

`-v, --verbose`
:   Verbose output

`-s, --start-directory directory`
:   Directory to start discovery (`.` default)

`-p, --pattern pattern`
:   Pattern to match test files (`test*.py` default)

`-t, --top-level-directory directory`
:   Top level directory of project (defaults to start directory)

The [`-s`](unittest.md#cmdoption-unittest-discover-s), [`-p`](unittest.md#cmdoption-unittest-discover-p), and [`-t`](unittest.md#cmdoption-unittest-discover-t) options can be passed in
as positional arguments in that order. The following two command lines
are equivalent:

```python3
python -m unittest discover -s project_directory -p "*_test.py"
python -m unittest discover project_directory "*_test.py"
```

As well as being a path it is possible to pass a package name, for example
`myproject.subpackage.test`, as the start directory. The package name you
supply will then be imported and its location on the filesystem will be used
as the start directory.

> **Caution:**
>
> Test discovery loads tests by importing them. Once test discovery has found
> all the test files from the start directory you specify it turns the paths
> into package names to import. For example `foo/bar/baz.py` will be
> imported as `foo.bar.baz`.
>
> If you have a package installed globally and attempt test discovery on
> a different copy of the package then the import *could* happen from the
> wrong place. If this happens test discovery will warn you and exit.
>
> If you supply the start directory as a package name rather than a
> path to a directory then discover assumes that whichever location it
> imports from is the location you intended, so you will not get the
> warning.

Test modules and packages can customize test loading and discovery by through
the [load_tests protocol](unittest.md#id1).

Changed in version 3.4: Test discovery supports [namespace packages](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-namespace-package)
for the start directory. Note that you need to specify the top level
directory too (e.g.
`python -m unittest discover -s root/namespace -t root`).

Changed in version 3.11: [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") dropped the [namespace packages](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-namespace-package)
support in Python 3.11. It has been broken since Python 3.7. Start directory and
subdirectories containing tests must be regular package that have
`__init__.py` file.

Directories containing start directory still can be a namespace package.
In this case, you need to specify start directory as dotted package name,
and target directory explicitly. For example:

```python3
# proj/  <-- current directory
#   namespace/
#     mypkg/
#       __init__.py
#       test_mypkg.py

python -m unittest discover -s namespace.mypkg -t .
```

## Organizing test code

The basic building blocks of unit testing are *test cases* — single
scenarios that must be set up and checked for correctness. In [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python."),
test cases are represented by [`unittest.TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instances.
To make your own test cases you must write subclasses of
[`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") or use [`FunctionTestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.FunctionTestCase "unittest.FunctionTestCase").

The testing code of a [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instance should be entirely self
contained, such that it can be run either in isolation or in arbitrary
combination with any number of other test cases.

The simplest [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") subclass will simply implement a test method
(i.e. a method whose name starts with `test`) in order to perform specific
testing code:

```python3
import unittest

class DefaultWidgetSizeTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_default_widget_size(self):
        widget = Widget('The widget')
        self.assertEqual(widget.size(), (50, 50))
```

Note that in order to test something, we use one of the [assert\* methods](unittest.md#assert-methods)
provided by the [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") base class. If the test fails, an
exception will be raised with an explanatory message, and [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.")
will identify the test case as a *failure*. Any other exceptions will be
treated as *errors*.

Tests can be numerous, and their set-up can be repetitive. Luckily, we
can factor out set-up code by implementing a method called
[`setUp()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUp "unittest.TestCase.setUp"), which the testing framework will automatically
call for every single test we run:

```python3
import unittest

class WidgetTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.widget = Widget('The widget')

    def test_default_widget_size(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.widget.size(), (50,50),
                         'incorrect default size')

    def test_widget_resize(self):
        self.widget.resize(100,150)
        self.assertEqual(self.widget.size(), (100,150),
                         'wrong size after resize')
```

> **Note:**
>
> The order in which the various tests will be run is determined
> by sorting the test method names with respect to the built-in
> ordering for strings.

If the [`setUp()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUp "unittest.TestCase.setUp") method raises an exception while the test is
running, the framework will consider the test to have suffered an error, and
the test method will not be executed.

Similarly, we can provide a [`tearDown()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.tearDown "unittest.TestCase.tearDown") method that tidies up
after the test method has been run:

```python3
import unittest

class WidgetTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.widget = Widget('The widget')

    def tearDown(self):
        self.widget.dispose()
```

If [`setUp()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUp "unittest.TestCase.setUp") succeeded, [`tearDown()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.tearDown "unittest.TestCase.tearDown") will be
run whether the test method succeeded or not.

Such a working environment for the testing code is called a
*test fixture*. A new TestCase instance is created as a unique
test fixture used to execute each individual test method. Thus
[`setUp()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUp "unittest.TestCase.setUp"), [`tearDown()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.tearDown "unittest.TestCase.tearDown"), and `__init__()`
will be called once per test.

It is recommended that you use TestCase implementations to group tests together
according to the features they test. [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") provides a mechanism for
this: the *test suite*, represented by [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.")’s
[`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") class. In most cases, calling [`unittest.main()`](unittest.md#unittest.main "unittest.main") will do
the right thing and collect all the module’s test cases for you and execute
them.

However, should you want to customize the building of your test suite,
you can do it yourself:

```python3
def suite():
    suite = unittest.TestSuite()
    suite.addTest(WidgetTestCase('test_default_widget_size'))
    suite.addTest(WidgetTestCase('test_widget_resize'))
    return suite

if __name__ == '__main__':
    runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()
    runner.run(suite())
```

You can place the definitions of test cases and test suites in the same modules
as the code they are to test (such as `widget.py`), but there are several
advantages to placing the test code in a separate module, such as
`test_widget.py`:

- The test module can be run standalone from the command line.
- The test code can more easily be separated from shipped code.
- There is less temptation to change test code to fit the code it tests without
  a good reason.
- Test code should be modified much less frequently than the code it tests.
- Tested code can be refactored more easily.
- Tests for modules written in C must be in separate modules anyway, so why not
  be consistent?
- If the testing strategy changes, there is no need to change the source code.

## Re-using old test code

Some users will find that they have existing test code that they would like to
run from [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python."), without converting every old test function to a
[`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") subclass.

For this reason, [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") provides a [`FunctionTestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.FunctionTestCase "unittest.FunctionTestCase") class.
This subclass of [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") can be used to wrap an existing test
function. Set-up and tear-down functions can also be provided.

Given the following test function:

```python3
def testSomething():
    something = makeSomething()
    assert something.name is not None
    # ...
```

one can create an equivalent test case instance as follows, with optional
set-up and tear-down methods:

```python3
testcase = unittest.FunctionTestCase(testSomething,
                                     setUp=makeSomethingDB,
                                     tearDown=deleteSomethingDB)
```

> **Note:**
>
> Even though [`FunctionTestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.FunctionTestCase "unittest.FunctionTestCase") can be used to quickly convert an
> existing test base over to a [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.")-based system, this approach is
> not recommended. Taking the time to set up proper [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase")
> subclasses will make future test refactorings infinitely easier.

In some cases, the existing tests may have been written using the [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.")
module. If so, [`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.") provides a `DocTestSuite` class that can
automatically build [`unittest.TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") instances from the existing
[`doctest`](doctest.md#module-doctest "doctest: Test pieces of code within docstrings.")-based tests.

## Skipping tests and expected failures

Added in version 3.1.

Unittest supports skipping individual test methods and even whole classes of
tests. In addition, it supports marking a test as an “expected failure,” a test
that is broken and will fail, but shouldn’t be counted as a failure on a
[`TestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult").

Skipping a test is simply a matter of using the [`skip()`](unittest.md#unittest.skip "unittest.skip") [decorator](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-decorator)
or one of its conditional variants, calling [`TestCase.skipTest()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.skipTest "unittest.TestCase.skipTest") within a
[`setUp()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUp "unittest.TestCase.setUp") or test method, or raising [`SkipTest`](unittest.md#unittest.SkipTest "unittest.SkipTest") directly.

Basic skipping looks like this:

```python3
class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skip("demonstrating skipping")
    def test_nothing(self):
        self.fail("shouldn't happen")

    @unittest.skipIf(mylib.__version__ < (1, 3),
                     "not supported in this library version")
    def test_format(self):
        # Tests that work for only a certain version of the library.
        pass

    @unittest.skipUnless(sys.platform.startswith("win"), "requires Windows")
    def test_windows_support(self):
        # windows specific testing code
        pass

    def test_maybe_skipped(self):
        if not external_resource_available():
            self.skipTest("external resource not available")
        # test code that depends on the external resource
        pass
```

This is the output of running the example above in verbose mode:

```python3
test_format (__main__.MyTestCase.test_format) ... skipped 'not supported in this library version'
test_nothing (__main__.MyTestCase.test_nothing) ... skipped 'demonstrating skipping'
test_maybe_skipped (__main__.MyTestCase.test_maybe_skipped) ... skipped 'external resource not available'
test_windows_support (__main__.MyTestCase.test_windows_support) ... skipped 'requires Windows'

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 4 tests in 0.005s

OK (skipped=4)
```

Classes can be skipped just like methods:

```python3
@unittest.skip("showing class skipping")
class MySkippedTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_not_run(self):
        pass
```

[`TestCase.setUp()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUp "unittest.TestCase.setUp") can also skip the test. This is useful when a resource
that needs to be set up is not available.

Expected failures use the [`expectedFailure()`](unittest.md#unittest.expectedFailure "unittest.expectedFailure") decorator.

```python3
class ExpectedFailureTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    @unittest.expectedFailure
    def test_fail(self):
        self.assertEqual(1, 0, "broken")
```

It’s easy to roll your own skipping decorators by making a decorator that calls
[`skip()`](unittest.md#unittest.skip "unittest.skip") on the test when it wants it to be skipped. This decorator skips
the test unless the passed object has a certain attribute:

```python3
def skipUnlessHasattr(obj, attr):
    if hasattr(obj, attr):
        return lambda func: func
    return unittest.skip("{!r} doesn't have {!r}".format(obj, attr))
```

The following decorators and exception implement test skipping and expected failures:

`@unittest.skip(reason)`
:   Unconditionally skip the decorated test. *reason* should describe why the
    test is being skipped.

`@unittest.skipIf(condition, reason)`
:   Skip the decorated test if *condition* is true.

`@unittest.skipUnless(condition, reason)`
:   Skip the decorated test unless *condition* is true.

`@unittest.expectedFailure`
:   Mark the test as an expected failure or error. If the test fails or errors
    in the test function itself (rather than in one of the *test fixture*
    methods) then it will be considered a success. If the test passes, it will
    be considered a failure.

`exception unittest.SkipTest(reason)`
:   This exception is raised to skip a test.

    Usually you can use [`TestCase.skipTest()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.skipTest "unittest.TestCase.skipTest") or one of the skipping
    decorators instead of raising this directly.

Skipped tests will not have [`setUp()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUp "unittest.TestCase.setUp") or [`tearDown()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.tearDown "unittest.TestCase.tearDown") run around them.
Skipped classes will not have [`setUpClass()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUpClass "unittest.TestCase.setUpClass") or [`tearDownClass()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.tearDownClass "unittest.TestCase.tearDownClass") run.
Skipped modules will not have `setUpModule()` or `tearDownModule()` run.

## Distinguishing test iterations using subtests

Added in version 3.4.

When there are very small differences among your tests, for
instance some parameters, unittest allows you to distinguish them inside
the body of a test method using the [`subTest()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.subTest "unittest.TestCase.subTest") context manager.

For example, the following test:

```python3
class NumbersTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_even(self):
        """
        Test that numbers between 0 and 5 are all even.
        """
        for i in range(0, 6):
            with self.subTest(i=i):
                self.assertEqual(i % 2, 0)
```

will produce the following output:

```python3
======================================================================
FAIL: test_even (__main__.NumbersTest.test_even) (i=1)
Test that numbers between 0 and 5 are all even.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "subtests.py", line 11, in test_even
    self.assertEqual(i % 2, 0)
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError: 1 != 0

======================================================================
FAIL: test_even (__main__.NumbersTest.test_even) (i=3)
Test that numbers between 0 and 5 are all even.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "subtests.py", line 11, in test_even
    self.assertEqual(i % 2, 0)

Without using a subtest, execution would stop after the first failure,
and the error would be less easy to diagnose because the value of `i`
wouldn’t be displayed:

```python3

## Classes and functions

This section describes in depth the API of [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.").

### Test cases

`class unittest.TestCase(methodName='runTest')`
:   Instances of the [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") class represent the logical test units
    in the [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") universe. This class is intended to be used as a base
    class, with specific tests being implemented by concrete subclasses. This class
    implements the interface needed by the test runner to allow it to drive the
    tests, and methods that the test code can use to check for and report various
    kinds of failure.

    Each instance of [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") will run a single base method: the method
    named *methodName*.
    In most uses of [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase"), you will neither change
    the *methodName* nor reimplement the default `runTest()` method.

    Changed in version 3.2: [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") can be instantiated successfully without providing a
    *methodName*. This makes it easier to experiment with [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase")
    from the interactive interpreter.

    [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instances provide three groups of methods: one group used
    to run the test, another used by the test implementation to check conditions
    and report failures, and some inquiry methods allowing information about the
    test itself to be gathered.

    Methods in the first group (running the test) are:

    `setUp()`
    :   Method called to prepare the test fixture. This is called immediately
        before calling the test method; other than [`AssertionError`](exceptions.md#AssertionError "AssertionError") or [`SkipTest`](unittest.md#unittest.SkipTest "unittest.SkipTest"),
        any exception raised by this method will be considered an error rather than
        a test failure. The default implementation does nothing.

    `tearDown()`
    :   Method called immediately after the test method has been called and the
        result recorded. This is called even if the test method raised an
        exception, so the implementation in subclasses may need to be particularly
        careful about checking internal state. Any exception, other than
        [`AssertionError`](exceptions.md#AssertionError "AssertionError") or [`SkipTest`](unittest.md#unittest.SkipTest "unittest.SkipTest"), raised by this method will be
        considered an additional error rather than a test failure (thus increasing
        the total number of reported errors). This method will only be called if
        the [`setUp()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUp "unittest.TestCase.setUp") succeeds, regardless of the outcome of the test method.
        The default implementation does nothing.

    `setUpClass()`
    :   A class method called before tests in an individual class are run.
        `setUpClass` is called with the class as the only argument
        and must be decorated as a [`classmethod()`](functions.md#classmethod "classmethod"):

        ```python3
        @classmethod
        def setUpClass(cls):
            ...
        ```

        See [Class and Module Fixtures](unittest.md#class-and-module-fixtures) for more details.

        Added in version 3.2.

    `tearDownClass()`
    :   A class method called after tests in an individual class have run.
        `tearDownClass` is called with the class as the only argument
        and must be decorated as a [`classmethod()`](functions.md#classmethod "classmethod"):

        ```python3
        @classmethod
        def tearDownClass(cls):
            ...
        ```

        See [Class and Module Fixtures](unittest.md#class-and-module-fixtures) for more details.

        Added in version 3.2.

    `run(result=None)`
    :   Run the test, collecting the result into the [`TestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") object
        passed as *result*. If *result* is omitted or `None`, a temporary
        result object is created (by calling the [`defaultTestResult()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.defaultTestResult "unittest.TestCase.defaultTestResult")
        method) and used. The result object is returned to [`run()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.run "unittest.TestCase.run")’s
        caller.

        The same effect may be had by simply calling the [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase")
        instance.

        Changed in version 3.3: Previous versions of `run` did not return the result. Neither did
        calling an instance.

    `skipTest(reason)`
    :   Calling this during a test method or [`setUp()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUp "unittest.TestCase.setUp") skips the current
        test. See [Skipping tests and expected failures](unittest.md#unittest-skipping) for more information.

        Added in version 3.1.

    `subTest(msg=None, **params)`
    :   Return a context manager which executes the enclosed code block as a
        subtest. *msg* and *params* are optional, arbitrary values which are
        displayed whenever a subtest fails, allowing you to identify them
        clearly.

        A test case can contain any number of subtest declarations, and
        they can be arbitrarily nested.

        See [Distinguishing test iterations using subtests](unittest.md#subtests) for more information.

        Added in version 3.4.

    `debug()`
    :   Run the test without collecting the result. This allows exceptions raised
        by the test to be propagated to the caller, and can be used to support
        running tests under a debugger.

    The [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") class provides several assert methods to check for and
    report failures. The following table lists the most commonly used methods
    (see the tables below for more assert methods):

    | Method | Checks that | New in |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | [`assertEqual(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertEqual") | `a == b` |  |
    | [`assertNotEqual(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertNotEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertNotEqual") | `a != b` |  |
    | [`assertTrue(x)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertTrue "unittest.TestCase.assertTrue") | `bool(x) is True` |  |
    | [`assertFalse(x)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertFalse "unittest.TestCase.assertFalse") | `bool(x) is False` |  |
    | [`assertIs(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertIs "unittest.TestCase.assertIs") | `a is b` | 3.1 |
    | [`assertIsNot(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertIsNot "unittest.TestCase.assertIsNot") | `a is not b` | 3.1 |
    | [`assertIsNone(x)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertIsNone "unittest.TestCase.assertIsNone") | `x is None` | 3.1 |
    | [`assertIsNotNone(x)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertIsNotNone "unittest.TestCase.assertIsNotNone") | `x is not None` | 3.1 |
    | [`assertIn(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertIn "unittest.TestCase.assertIn") | `a in b` | 3.1 |
    | [`assertNotIn(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertNotIn "unittest.TestCase.assertNotIn") | `a not in b` | 3.1 |
    | [`assertIsInstance(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertIsInstance "unittest.TestCase.assertIsInstance") | `isinstance(a, b)` | 3.2 |
    | [`assertNotIsInstance(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertNotIsInstance "unittest.TestCase.assertNotIsInstance") | `not isinstance(a, b)` | 3.2 |

    All the assert methods accept a *msg* argument that, if specified, is used
    as the error message on failure (see also [`longMessage`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.longMessage "unittest.TestCase.longMessage")).
    Note that the *msg* keyword argument can be passed to [`assertRaises()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises "unittest.TestCase.assertRaises"),
    [`assertRaisesRegex()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertRaisesRegex "unittest.TestCase.assertRaisesRegex"), [`assertWarns()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertWarns "unittest.TestCase.assertWarns"), [`assertWarnsRegex()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertWarnsRegex "unittest.TestCase.assertWarnsRegex")
    only when they are used as a context manager.

    `assertEqual(first, second, msg=None)`
    :   Test that *first* and *second* are equal. If the values do not
        compare equal, the test will fail.

        In addition, if *first* and *second* are the exact same type and one of
        list, tuple, dict, set, frozenset or str or any type that a subclass
        registers with [`addTypeEqualityFunc()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.addTypeEqualityFunc "unittest.TestCase.addTypeEqualityFunc") the type-specific equality
        function will be called in order to generate a more useful default
        error message (see also the [list of type-specific methods](unittest.md#type-specific-methods)).

        Changed in version 3.1: Added the automatic calling of type-specific equality function.

        Changed in version 3.2: [`assertMultiLineEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertMultiLineEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertMultiLineEqual") added as the default type equality
        function for comparing strings.

    `assertNotEqual(first, second, msg=None)`
    :   Test that *first* and *second* are not equal. If the values do
        compare equal, the test will fail.

    `assertTrue(expr, msg=None)`

    `assertFalse(expr, msg=None)`
    :   Test that *expr* is true (or false).

        Note that this is equivalent to `bool(expr) is True` and not to `expr
        is True` (use `assertIs(expr, True)` for the latter). This method
        should also be avoided when more specific methods are available (e.g.
        `assertEqual(a, b)` instead of `assertTrue(a == b)`), because they
        provide a better error message in case of failure.

    `assertIs(first, second, msg=None)`

    `assertIsNot(first, second, msg=None)`
    :   Test that *first* and *second* are (or are not) the same object.

        Added in version 3.1.

    `assertIsNone(expr, msg=None)`

    `assertIsNotNone(expr, msg=None)`
    :   Test that *expr* is (or is not) `None`.

        Added in version 3.1.

    `assertIn(member, container, msg=None)`

    `assertNotIn(member, container, msg=None)`
    :   Test that *member* is (or is not) in *container*.

        Added in version 3.1.

    `assertIsInstance(obj, cls, msg=None)`

    `assertNotIsInstance(obj, cls, msg=None)`
    :   Test that *obj* is (or is not) an instance of *cls* (which can be a
        class or a tuple of classes, as supported by [`isinstance()`](functions.md#isinstance "isinstance")).
        To check for the exact type, use [`assertIs(type(obj), cls)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertIs "unittest.TestCase.assertIs").

        Added in version 3.2.

    It is also possible to check the production of exceptions, warnings, and
    log messages using the following methods:

    | Method | Checks that | New in |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | [`assertRaises(exc, fun, *args, **kwds)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises "unittest.TestCase.assertRaises") | `fun(*args, **kwds)` raises *exc* |  |
    | [`assertRaisesRegex(exc, r, fun, *args, **kwds)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertRaisesRegex "unittest.TestCase.assertRaisesRegex") | `fun(*args, **kwds)` raises *exc* and the message matches regex *r* | 3.1 |
    | [`assertWarns(warn, fun, *args, **kwds)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertWarns "unittest.TestCase.assertWarns") | `fun(*args, **kwds)` raises *warn* | 3.2 |
    | [`assertWarnsRegex(warn, r, fun, *args, **kwds)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertWarnsRegex "unittest.TestCase.assertWarnsRegex") | `fun(*args, **kwds)` raises *warn* and the message matches regex *r* | 3.2 |
    | [`assertLogs(logger, level)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertLogs "unittest.TestCase.assertLogs") | The `with` block logs on *logger* with minimum *level* | 3.4 |
    | [`assertNoLogs(logger, level)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertNoLogs "unittest.TestCase.assertNoLogs") | The `with` block does not log on  *logger* with minimum *level* | 3.10 |

    `assertRaises(exception, callable, *args, **kwds)`

    `assertRaises(exception, *, msg=None)`
    :   Test that an exception is raised when *callable* is called with any
        positional or keyword arguments that are also passed to
        [`assertRaises()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises "unittest.TestCase.assertRaises"). The test passes if *exception* is raised, is an
        error if another exception is raised, or fails if no exception is raised.
        To catch any of a group of exceptions, a tuple containing the exception
        classes may be passed as *exception*.

        If only the *exception* and possibly the *msg* arguments are given,
        return a context manager so that the code under test can be written
        inline rather than as a function:

        ```python3
        with self.assertRaises(SomeException):
            do_something()
        ```

        When used as a context manager, [`assertRaises()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises "unittest.TestCase.assertRaises") accepts the
        additional keyword argument *msg*.

        The context manager will store the caught exception object in its
        `exception` attribute. This can be useful if the intention
        is to perform additional checks on the exception raised:

        ```python3
        with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
            do_something()

        the_exception = cm.exception
        self.assertEqual(the_exception.error_code, 3)
        ```

        Changed in version 3.1: Added the ability to use [`assertRaises()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises "unittest.TestCase.assertRaises") as a context manager.

        Changed in version 3.2: Added the `exception` attribute.

        Changed in version 3.3: Added the *msg* keyword argument when used as a context manager.

    `assertRaisesRegex(exception, regex, callable, *args, **kwds)`

    `assertRaisesRegex(exception, regex, *, msg=None)`
    :   Like [`assertRaises()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises "unittest.TestCase.assertRaises") but also tests that *regex* matches
        on the string representation of the raised exception. *regex* may be
        a regular expression object or a string containing a regular expression
        suitable for use by [`re.search()`](re.md#re.search "re.search"). Examples:

        ```python3
        self.assertRaisesRegex(ValueError, "invalid literal for.*XYZ'$",
                               int, 'XYZ')
        ```

        or:

        ```python3
        with self.assertRaisesRegex(ValueError, 'literal'):
           int('XYZ')
        ```

        Added in version 3.1: Added under the name `assertRaisesRegexp`.

        Changed in version 3.2: Renamed to [`assertRaisesRegex()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertRaisesRegex "unittest.TestCase.assertRaisesRegex").

        Changed in version 3.3: Added the *msg* keyword argument when used as a context manager.

    `assertWarns(warning, callable, *args, **kwds)`

    `assertWarns(warning, *, msg=None)`
    :   Test that a warning is triggered when *callable* is called with any
        positional or keyword arguments that are also passed to
        [`assertWarns()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertWarns "unittest.TestCase.assertWarns"). The test passes if *warning* is triggered and
        fails if it isn’t. Any exception is an error.
        To catch any of a group of warnings, a tuple containing the warning
        classes may be passed as *warnings*.

        If only the *warning* and possibly the *msg* arguments are given,
        return a context manager so that the code under test can be written
        inline rather than as a function:

        ```python3
        with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning):
            do_something()
        ```

        When used as a context manager, [`assertWarns()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertWarns "unittest.TestCase.assertWarns") accepts the
        additional keyword argument *msg*.

        The context manager will store the caught warning object in its
        `warning` attribute, and the source line which triggered the
        warnings in the `filename` and `lineno` attributes.
        This can be useful if the intention is to perform additional checks
        on the warning caught:

        ```python3
        with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning) as cm:
            do_something()

        self.assertIn('myfile.py', cm.filename)
        self.assertEqual(320, cm.lineno)
        ```

        This method works regardless of the warning filters in place when it
        is called.

        Added in version 3.2.

        Changed in version 3.3: Added the *msg* keyword argument when used as a context manager.

    `assertWarnsRegex(warning, regex, callable, *args, **kwds)`

    `assertWarnsRegex(warning, regex, *, msg=None)`
    :   Like [`assertWarns()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertWarns "unittest.TestCase.assertWarns") but also tests that *regex* matches on the
        message of the triggered warning. *regex* may be a regular expression
        object or a string containing a regular expression suitable for use
        by [`re.search()`](re.md#re.search "re.search"). Example:

        ```python3
        self.assertWarnsRegex(DeprecationWarning,
                              r'legacy_function\(\) is deprecated',
                              legacy_function, 'XYZ')
        ```

        or:

        ```python3
        with self.assertWarnsRegex(RuntimeWarning, 'unsafe frobnicating'):
            frobnicate('/etc/passwd')
        ```

        Added in version 3.2.

        Changed in version 3.3: Added the *msg* keyword argument when used as a context manager.

    `assertLogs(logger=None, level=None)`
    :   A context manager to test that at least one message is logged on
        the *logger* or one of its children, with at least the given
        *level*.

        If given, *logger* should be a [`logging.Logger`](logging.md#logging.Logger "logging.Logger") object or a
        [`str`](stdtypes.md#str "str") giving the name of a logger. The default is the root
        logger, which will catch all messages that were not blocked by a
        non-propagating descendent logger.

        If given, *level* should be either a numeric logging level or
        its string equivalent (for example either `"ERROR"` or
        [`logging.ERROR`](logging.md#logging.ERROR "logging.ERROR")). The default is [`logging.INFO`](logging.md#logging.INFO "logging.INFO").

        The test passes if at least one message emitted inside the `with`
        block matches the *logger* and *level* conditions, otherwise it fails.

        The object returned by the context manager is a recording helper
        which keeps tracks of the matching log messages. It has two
        attributes:

        `records`
        :   A list of [`logging.LogRecord`](logging.md#logging.LogRecord "logging.LogRecord") objects of the matching
            log messages.

        `output`
        :   A list of [`str`](stdtypes.md#str "str") objects with the formatted output of
            matching messages.

        Example:

        ```python3
        with self.assertLogs('foo', level='INFO') as cm:
            logging.getLogger('foo').info('first message')
            logging.getLogger('foo.bar').error('second message')
        self.assertEqual(cm.output, ['INFO:foo:first message',
                                     'ERROR:foo.bar:second message'])
        ```

        Added in version 3.4.

    `assertNoLogs(logger=None, level=None)`
    :   A context manager to test that no messages are logged on
        the *logger* or one of its children, with at least the given
        *level*.

        If given, *logger* should be a [`logging.Logger`](logging.md#logging.Logger "logging.Logger") object or a
        [`str`](stdtypes.md#str "str") giving the name of a logger. The default is the root
        logger, which will catch all messages.

        If given, *level* should be either a numeric logging level or
        its string equivalent (for example either `"ERROR"` or
        [`logging.ERROR`](logging.md#logging.ERROR "logging.ERROR")). The default is [`logging.INFO`](logging.md#logging.INFO "logging.INFO").

        Unlike [`assertLogs()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertLogs "unittest.TestCase.assertLogs"), nothing will be returned by the context
        manager.

        Added in version 3.10.

    There are also other methods used to perform more specific checks, such as:

    | Method | Checks that | New in |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | [`assertAlmostEqual(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertAlmostEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertAlmostEqual") | `round(a-b, 7) == 0` |  |
    | [`assertNotAlmostEqual(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertNotAlmostEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertNotAlmostEqual") | `round(a-b, 7) != 0` |  |
    | [`assertGreater(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertGreater "unittest.TestCase.assertGreater") | `a > b` | 3.1 |
    | [`assertGreaterEqual(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertGreaterEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertGreaterEqual") | `a >= b` | 3.1 |
    | [`assertLess(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertLess "unittest.TestCase.assertLess") | `a < b` | 3.1 |
    | [`assertLessEqual(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertLessEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertLessEqual") | `a <= b` | 3.1 |
    | [`assertRegex(s, r)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertRegex "unittest.TestCase.assertRegex") | `r.search(s)` | 3.1 |
    | [`assertNotRegex(s, r)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertNotRegex "unittest.TestCase.assertNotRegex") | `not r.search(s)` | 3.2 |
    | [`assertCountEqual(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertCountEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertCountEqual") | *a* and *b* have the same elements in the same number, regardless of their order. | 3.2 |

    `assertAlmostEqual(first, second, places=7, msg=None, delta=None)`

    `assertNotAlmostEqual(first, second, places=7, msg=None, delta=None)`
    :   Test that *first* and *second* are approximately (or not approximately)
        equal by computing the difference, rounding to the given number of
        decimal *places* (default 7), and comparing to zero. Note that these
        methods round the values to the given number of *decimal places* (i.e.
        like the [`round()`](functions.md#round "round") function) and not *significant digits*.

        If *delta* is supplied instead of *places* then the difference
        between *first* and *second* must be less or equal to (or greater than) *delta*.

        Supplying both *delta* and *places* raises a [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError "TypeError").

        Changed in version 3.2: [`assertAlmostEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertAlmostEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertAlmostEqual") automatically considers almost equal objects
        that compare equal. [`assertNotAlmostEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertNotAlmostEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertNotAlmostEqual") automatically fails
        if the objects compare equal. Added the *delta* keyword argument.

    `assertGreater(first, second, msg=None)`

    `assertGreaterEqual(first, second, msg=None)`

    `assertLess(first, second, msg=None)`

    `assertLessEqual(first, second, msg=None)`
    :   Test that *first* is respectively >, >=, < or <= than *second* depending
        on the method name. If not, the test will fail:

        ```python3
        >>> self.assertGreaterEqual(3, 4)
        AssertionError: "3" unexpectedly not greater than or equal to "4"
        ```

        Added in version 3.1.

    `assertRegex(text, regex, msg=None)`

    `assertNotRegex(text, regex, msg=None)`
    :   Test that a *regex* search matches (or does not match) *text*. In case
        of failure, the error message will include the pattern and the *text* (or
        the pattern and the part of *text* that unexpectedly matched). *regex*
        may be a regular expression object or a string containing a regular
        expression suitable for use by [`re.search()`](re.md#re.search "re.search").

        Added in version 3.1: Added under the name `assertRegexpMatches`.

        Changed in version 3.2: The method `assertRegexpMatches()` has been renamed to
        [`assertRegex()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertRegex "unittest.TestCase.assertRegex").

        Added in version 3.2: [`assertNotRegex()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertNotRegex "unittest.TestCase.assertNotRegex").

    `assertCountEqual(first, second, msg=None)`
    :   Test that sequence *first* contains the same elements as *second*,
        regardless of their order. When they don’t, an error message listing the
        differences between the sequences will be generated.

        Duplicate elements are *not* ignored when comparing *first* and
        *second*. It verifies whether each element has the same count in both
        sequences. Equivalent to:
        `assertEqual(Counter(list(first)), Counter(list(second)))`
        but works with sequences of unhashable objects as well.

        Added in version 3.2.

    The [`assertEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertEqual") method dispatches the equality check for objects of
    the same type to different type-specific methods. These methods are already
    implemented for most of the built-in types, but it’s also possible to
    register new methods using [`addTypeEqualityFunc()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.addTypeEqualityFunc "unittest.TestCase.addTypeEqualityFunc"):

    `addTypeEqualityFunc(typeobj, function)`
    :   Registers a type-specific method called by [`assertEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertEqual") to check
        if two objects of exactly the same *typeobj* (not subclasses) compare
        equal. *function* must take two positional arguments and a third msg=None
        keyword argument just as [`assertEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertEqual") does. It must raise
        [`self.failureException(msg)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.failureException "unittest.TestCase.failureException") when inequality
        between the first two parameters is detected – possibly providing useful
        information and explaining the inequalities in details in the error
        message.

        Added in version 3.1.

    The list of type-specific methods automatically used by
    [`assertEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertEqual") are summarized in the following table. Note
    that it’s usually not necessary to invoke these methods directly.

    | Method | Used to compare | New in |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | [`assertMultiLineEqual(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertMultiLineEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertMultiLineEqual") | strings | 3.1 |
    | [`assertSequenceEqual(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertSequenceEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertSequenceEqual") | sequences | 3.1 |
    | [`assertListEqual(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertListEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertListEqual") | lists | 3.1 |
    | [`assertTupleEqual(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertTupleEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertTupleEqual") | tuples | 3.1 |
    | [`assertSetEqual(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertSetEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertSetEqual") | sets or frozensets | 3.1 |
    | [`assertDictEqual(a, b)`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertDictEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertDictEqual") | dicts | 3.1 |

    `assertMultiLineEqual(first, second, msg=None)`
    :   Test that the multiline string *first* is equal to the string *second*.
        When not equal a diff of the two strings highlighting the differences
        will be included in the error message. This method is used by default
        when comparing strings with [`assertEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertEqual").

        Added in version 3.1.

    `assertSequenceEqual(first, second, msg=None, seq_type=None)`
    :   Tests that two sequences are equal. If a *seq_type* is supplied, both
        *first* and *second* must be instances of *seq_type* or a failure will
        be raised. If the sequences are different an error message is
        constructed that shows the difference between the two.

        This method is not called directly by [`assertEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertEqual"), but
        it’s used to implement [`assertListEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertListEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertListEqual") and
        [`assertTupleEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertTupleEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertTupleEqual").

        Added in version 3.1.

    `assertListEqual(first, second, msg=None)`

    `assertTupleEqual(first, second, msg=None)`
    :   Tests that two lists or tuples are equal. If not, an error message is
        constructed that shows only the differences between the two. An error
        is also raised if either of the parameters are of the wrong type.
        These methods are used by default when comparing lists or tuples with
        [`assertEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertEqual").

        Added in version 3.1.

    `assertSetEqual(first, second, msg=None)`
    :   Tests that two sets are equal. If not, an error message is constructed
        that lists the differences between the sets. This method is used by
        default when comparing sets or frozensets with [`assertEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertEqual").

        Fails if either of *first* or *second* does not have a `set.difference()`
        method.

        Added in version 3.1.

    `assertDictEqual(first, second, msg=None)`
    :   Test that two dictionaries are equal. If not, an error message is
        constructed that shows the differences in the dictionaries. This
        method will be used by default to compare dictionaries in
        calls to [`assertEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertEqual").

        Added in version 3.1.

    Finally the [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") provides the following methods and attributes:

    `fail(msg=None)`
    :   Signals a test failure unconditionally, with *msg* or `None` for
        the error message.

    `failureException`
    :   This class attribute gives the exception raised by the test method. If a
        test framework needs to use a specialized exception, possibly to carry
        additional information, it must subclass this exception in order to “play
        fair” with the framework. The initial value of this attribute is
        [`AssertionError`](exceptions.md#AssertionError "AssertionError").

    `longMessage`
    :   This class attribute determines what happens when a custom failure message
        is passed as the msg argument to an assertXYY call that fails.
        `True` is the default value. In this case, the custom message is appended
        to the end of the standard failure message.
        When set to `False`, the custom message replaces the standard message.

        The class setting can be overridden in individual test methods by assigning
        an instance attribute, self.longMessage, to `True` or `False` before
        calling the assert methods.

        The class setting gets reset before each test call.

        Added in version 3.1.

    `maxDiff`
    :   This attribute controls the maximum length of diffs output by assert
        methods that report diffs on failure. It defaults to 80\*8 characters.
        Assert methods affected by this attribute are
        [`assertSequenceEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertSequenceEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertSequenceEqual") (including all the sequence comparison
        methods that delegate to it), [`assertDictEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertDictEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertDictEqual") and
        [`assertMultiLineEqual()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.assertMultiLineEqual "unittest.TestCase.assertMultiLineEqual").

        Setting `maxDiff` to `None` means that there is no maximum length of
        diffs.

        Added in version 3.2.

    Testing frameworks can use the following methods to collect information on
    the test:

    `countTestCases()`
    :   Return the number of tests represented by this test object. For
        [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instances, this will always be `1`.

    `defaultTestResult()`
    :   Return an instance of the test result class that should be used for this
        test case class (if no other result instance is provided to the
        [`run()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.run "unittest.TestCase.run") method).

        For [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instances, this will always be an instance of
        [`TestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult"); subclasses of [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") should override this
        as necessary.

    `id()`
    :   Return a string identifying the specific test case. This is usually the
        full name of the test method, including the module and class name.

    `shortDescription()`
    :   Returns a description of the test, or `None` if no description
        has been provided. The default implementation of this method
        returns the first line of the test method’s docstring, if available,
        or `None`.

        Changed in version 3.1: In 3.1 this was changed to add the test name to the short description
        even in the presence of a docstring. This caused compatibility issues
        with unittest extensions and adding the test name was moved to the
        [`TextTestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TextTestResult "unittest.TextTestResult") in Python 3.2.

    `addCleanup(function, /, *args, **kwargs)`
    :   Add a function to be called after [`tearDown()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.tearDown "unittest.TestCase.tearDown") to cleanup resources
        used during the test. Functions will be called in reverse order to the
        order they are added (LIFO). They
        are called with any arguments and keyword arguments passed into
        [`addCleanup()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.addCleanup "unittest.TestCase.addCleanup") when they are added.

        If [`setUp()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUp "unittest.TestCase.setUp") fails, meaning that [`tearDown()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.tearDown "unittest.TestCase.tearDown") is not called,
        then any cleanup functions added will still be called.

        Added in version 3.1.

    `enterContext(cm)`
    :   Enter the supplied [context manager](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-context-manager). If successful, also
        add its [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") method as a cleanup function by
        [`addCleanup()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.addCleanup "unittest.TestCase.addCleanup") and return the result of the
        [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") method.

        Added in version 3.11.

    `doCleanups()`
    :   This method is called unconditionally after [`tearDown()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.tearDown "unittest.TestCase.tearDown"), or
        after [`setUp()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUp "unittest.TestCase.setUp") if [`setUp()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUp "unittest.TestCase.setUp") raises an exception.

        It is responsible for calling all the cleanup functions added by
        [`addCleanup()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.addCleanup "unittest.TestCase.addCleanup"). If you need cleanup functions to be called
        *prior* to [`tearDown()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.tearDown "unittest.TestCase.tearDown") then you can call [`doCleanups()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.doCleanups "unittest.TestCase.doCleanups")
        yourself.

        [`doCleanups()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.doCleanups "unittest.TestCase.doCleanups") pops methods off the stack of cleanup
        functions one at a time, so it can be called at any time.

        Added in version 3.1.

    `classmethod addClassCleanup(function, /, *args, **kwargs)`
    :   Add a function to be called after [`tearDownClass()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.tearDownClass "unittest.TestCase.tearDownClass") to cleanup
        resources used during the test class. Functions will be called in reverse
        order to the order they are added (LIFO).
        They are called with any arguments and keyword arguments passed into
        [`addClassCleanup()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.addClassCleanup "unittest.TestCase.addClassCleanup") when they are added.

        If [`setUpClass()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUpClass "unittest.TestCase.setUpClass") fails, meaning that [`tearDownClass()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.tearDownClass "unittest.TestCase.tearDownClass") is not
        called, then any cleanup functions added will still be called.

        Added in version 3.8.

    `classmethod enterClassContext(cm)`
    :   Enter the supplied [context manager](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-context-manager). If successful, also
        add its [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") method as a cleanup function by
        [`addClassCleanup()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.addClassCleanup "unittest.TestCase.addClassCleanup") and return the result of the
        [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") method.

        Added in version 3.11.

    `classmethod doClassCleanups()`
    :   This method is called unconditionally after [`tearDownClass()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.tearDownClass "unittest.TestCase.tearDownClass"), or
        after [`setUpClass()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUpClass "unittest.TestCase.setUpClass") if [`setUpClass()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.setUpClass "unittest.TestCase.setUpClass") raises an exception.

        It is responsible for calling all the cleanup functions added by
        [`addClassCleanup()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.addClassCleanup "unittest.TestCase.addClassCleanup"). If you need cleanup functions to be called
        *prior* to [`tearDownClass()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.tearDownClass "unittest.TestCase.tearDownClass") then you can call
        [`doClassCleanups()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.doClassCleanups "unittest.TestCase.doClassCleanups") yourself.

        [`doClassCleanups()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.doClassCleanups "unittest.TestCase.doClassCleanups") pops methods off the stack of cleanup
        functions one at a time, so it can be called at any time.

        Added in version 3.8.

`class unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase(methodName='runTest')`
:   This class provides an API similar to [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") and also accepts
    coroutines as test functions.

    Added in version 3.8.

    `async asyncSetUp()`
    :   Method called to prepare the test fixture. This is called after `setUp()`.
        This is called immediately before calling the test method; other than
        [`AssertionError`](exceptions.md#AssertionError "AssertionError") or [`SkipTest`](unittest.md#unittest.SkipTest "unittest.SkipTest"), any exception raised by this method
        will be considered an error rather than a test failure. The default implementation
        does nothing.

    `async asyncTearDown()`
    :   Method called immediately after the test method has been called and the
        result recorded. This is called before `tearDown()`. This is called even if
        the test method raised an exception, so the implementation in subclasses may need
        to be particularly careful about checking internal state. Any exception, other than
        [`AssertionError`](exceptions.md#AssertionError "AssertionError") or [`SkipTest`](unittest.md#unittest.SkipTest "unittest.SkipTest"), raised by this method will be
        considered an additional error rather than a test failure (thus increasing
        the total number of reported errors). This method will only be called if
        the [`asyncSetUp()`](unittest.md#unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase.asyncSetUp "unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase.asyncSetUp") succeeds, regardless of the outcome of the test method.
        The default implementation does nothing.

    `addAsyncCleanup(function, /, *args, **kwargs)`
    :   This method accepts a coroutine that can be used as a cleanup function.

    `async enterAsyncContext(cm)`
    :   Enter the supplied [asynchronous context manager](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-context-manager). If successful,
        also add its [`__aexit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aexit__ "object.__aexit__") method as a cleanup function by
        [`addAsyncCleanup()`](unittest.md#unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase.addAsyncCleanup "unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase.addAsyncCleanup") and return the result of the
        [`__aenter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aenter__ "object.__aenter__") method.

        Added in version 3.11.

    `run(result=None)`
    :   Sets up a new event loop to run the test, collecting the result into
        the [`TestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") object passed as *result*. If *result* is
        omitted or `None`, a temporary result object is created (by calling
        the `defaultTestResult()` method) and used. The result object is
        returned to [`run()`](unittest.md#unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase.run "unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase.run")’s caller. At the end of the test all the tasks
        in the event loop are cancelled.

    An example illustrating the order:

    ```python3
    from unittest import IsolatedAsyncioTestCase

    events = []

    class Test(IsolatedAsyncioTestCase):

        def setUp(self):
            events.append("setUp")

        async def asyncSetUp(self):
            self._async_connection = await AsyncConnection()
            events.append("asyncSetUp")

        async def test_response(self):
            events.append("test_response")
            response = await self._async_connection.get("https://example.com")
            self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
            self.addAsyncCleanup(self.on_cleanup)

        def tearDown(self):
            events.append("tearDown")

        async def asyncTearDown(self):
            await self._async_connection.close()
            events.append("asyncTearDown")

        async def on_cleanup(self):
            events.append("cleanup")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        unittest.main()
    ```

    After running the test, `events` would contain `["setUp", "asyncSetUp", "test_response", "asyncTearDown", "tearDown", "cleanup"]`.

`class unittest.FunctionTestCase(testFunc, setUp=None, tearDown=None, description=None)`
:   This class implements the portion of the [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") interface which
    allows the test runner to drive the test, but does not provide the methods
    which test code can use to check and report errors. This is used to create
    test cases using legacy test code, allowing it to be integrated into a
    [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.")-based test framework.

### Grouping tests

`class unittest.TestSuite(tests=())`
:   This class represents an aggregation of individual test cases and test suites.
    The class presents the interface needed by the test runner to allow it to be run
    as any other test case. Running a [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") instance is the same as
    iterating over the suite, running each test individually.

    If *tests* is given, it must be an iterable of individual test cases or other
    test suites that will be used to build the suite initially. Additional methods
    are provided to add test cases and suites to the collection later on.

    [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") objects behave much like [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") objects, except
    they do not actually implement a test. Instead, they are used to aggregate
    tests into groups of tests that should be run together. Some additional
    methods are available to add tests to [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") instances:

    `addTest(test)`
    :   Add a [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") or [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") to the suite.

    `addTests(tests)`
    :   Add all the tests from an iterable of [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") and [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite")
        instances to this test suite.

        This is equivalent to iterating over *tests*, calling [`addTest()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite.addTest "unittest.TestSuite.addTest") for
        each element.

    [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") shares the following methods with [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase"):

    `run(result)`
    :   Run the tests associated with this suite, collecting the result into the
        test result object passed as *result*. Note that unlike
        [`TestCase.run()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase.run "unittest.TestCase.run"), [`TestSuite.run()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite.run "unittest.TestSuite.run") requires the result object to
        be passed in.

    `debug()`
    :   Run the tests associated with this suite without collecting the
        result. This allows exceptions raised by the test to be propagated to the
        caller and can be used to support running tests under a debugger.

    `countTestCases()`
    :   Return the number of tests represented by this test object, including all
        individual tests and sub-suites.

    `__iter__()`
    :   Tests grouped by a [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") are always accessed by iteration.
        Subclasses can lazily provide tests by overriding `__iter__()`. Note
        that this method may be called several times on a single suite (for
        example when counting tests or comparing for equality) so the tests
        returned by repeated iterations before [`TestSuite.run()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite.run "unittest.TestSuite.run") must be the
        same for each call iteration. After [`TestSuite.run()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite.run "unittest.TestSuite.run"), callers should
        not rely on the tests returned by this method unless the caller uses a
        subclass that overrides `TestSuite._removeTestAtIndex()` to preserve
        test references.

        Changed in version 3.2: In earlier versions the [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") accessed tests directly rather
        than through iteration, so overriding `__iter__()` wasn’t sufficient
        for providing tests.

        Changed in version 3.4: In earlier versions the [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") held references to each
        [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") after [`TestSuite.run()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite.run "unittest.TestSuite.run"). Subclasses can restore
        that behavior by overriding `TestSuite._removeTestAtIndex()`.

    In the typical usage of a [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") object, the [`run()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite.run "unittest.TestSuite.run") method
    is invoked by a `TestRunner` rather than by the end-user test harness.

### Loading and running tests

`class unittest.TestLoader`
:   The [`TestLoader`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader "unittest.TestLoader") class is used to create test suites from classes and
    modules. Normally, there is no need to create an instance of this class; the
    [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") module provides an instance that can be shared as
    [`unittest.defaultTestLoader`](unittest.md#unittest.defaultTestLoader "unittest.defaultTestLoader"). Using a subclass or instance, however,
    allows customization of some configurable properties.

    [`TestLoader`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader "unittest.TestLoader") objects have the following attributes:

    `errors`
    :   A list of the non-fatal errors encountered while loading tests. Not reset
        by the loader at any point. Fatal errors are signalled by the relevant
        method raising an exception to the caller. Non-fatal errors are also
        indicated by a synthetic test that will raise the original error when
        run.

        Added in version 3.5.

    [`TestLoader`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader "unittest.TestLoader") objects have the following methods:

    `loadTestsFromTestCase(testCaseClass)`
    :   Return a suite of all test cases contained in the [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase")-derived
        `testCaseClass`.

        A test case instance is created for each method named by
        [`getTestCaseNames()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader.getTestCaseNames "unittest.TestLoader.getTestCaseNames"). By default these are the method names
        beginning with `test`. If [`getTestCaseNames()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader.getTestCaseNames "unittest.TestLoader.getTestCaseNames") returns no
        methods, but the `runTest()` method is implemented, a single test
        case is created for that method instead.

    `loadTestsFromModule(module, *, pattern=None)`
    :   Return a suite of all test cases contained in the given module. This
        method searches *module* for classes derived from [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") and
        creates an instance of the class for each test method defined for the
        class.

        > **Note:**
        >
        > While using a hierarchy of [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase")-derived classes can be
        > convenient in sharing fixtures and helper functions, defining test
        > methods on base classes that are not intended to be instantiated
        > directly does not play well with this method. Doing so, however, can
        > be useful when the fixtures are different and defined in subclasses.

        If a module provides a `load_tests` function it will be called to
        load the tests. This allows modules to customize test loading.
        This is the [load_tests protocol](unittest.md#id1). The *pattern* argument is passed as
        the third argument to `load_tests`.

        Changed in version 3.2: Support for `load_tests` added.

        Changed in version 3.5: Support for a keyword-only argument *pattern* has been added.

        Changed in version 3.12: The undocumented and unofficial *use_load_tests* parameter has been
        removed.

    `loadTestsFromName(name, module=None)`
    :   Return a suite of all test cases given a string specifier.

        The specifier *name* is a “dotted name” that may resolve either to a
        module, a test case class, a test method within a test case class, a
        [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") instance, or a callable object which returns a
        [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") or [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") instance. These checks are
        applied in the order listed here; that is, a method on a possible test
        case class will be picked up as “a test method within a test case class”,
        rather than “a callable object”.

        For example, if you have a module `SampleTests` containing a
        [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase")-derived class `SampleTestCase` with three test
        methods (`test_one()`, `test_two()`, and `test_three()`), the
        specifier `'SampleTests.SampleTestCase'` would cause this method to
        return a suite which will run all three test methods. Using the specifier
        `'SampleTests.SampleTestCase.test_two'` would cause it to return a test
        suite which will run only the `test_two()` test method. The specifier
        can refer to modules and packages which have not been imported; they will
        be imported as a side-effect.

        The method optionally resolves *name* relative to the given *module*.

        Changed in version 3.5: If an [`ImportError`](exceptions.md#ImportError "ImportError") or [`AttributeError`](exceptions.md#AttributeError "AttributeError") occurs while traversing
        *name* then a synthetic test that raises that error when run will be
        returned. These errors are included in the errors accumulated by
        self.errors.

    `loadTestsFromNames(names, module=None)`
    :   Similar to [`loadTestsFromName()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromName "unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromName"), but takes a sequence of names rather
        than a single name. The return value is a test suite which supports all
        the tests defined for each name.

    `getTestCaseNames(testCaseClass)`
    :   Return a sorted sequence of method names found within *testCaseClass*;
        this should be a subclass of [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase").

    `discover(start_dir, pattern='test*.py', top_level_dir=None)`
    :   Find all the test modules by recursing into subdirectories from the
        specified start directory, and return a TestSuite object containing them.
        Only test files that match *pattern* will be loaded. (Using shell style
        pattern matching.) Only module names that are importable (i.e. are valid
        Python identifiers) will be loaded.

        All test modules must be importable from the top level of the project. If
        the start directory is not the top level directory then *top_level_dir*
        must be specified separately.

        If importing a module fails, for example due to a syntax error, then
        this will be recorded as a single error and discovery will continue. If
        the import failure is due to [`SkipTest`](unittest.md#unittest.SkipTest "unittest.SkipTest") being raised, it will be
        recorded as a skip instead of an error.

        If a package (a directory containing a file named `__init__.py`) is
        found, the package will be checked for a `load_tests` function. If this
        exists then it will be called
        `package.load_tests(loader, tests, pattern)`. Test discovery takes care
        to ensure that a package is only checked for tests once during an
        invocation, even if the load_tests function itself calls
        `loader.discover`.

        If `load_tests` exists then discovery does *not* recurse into the
        package, `load_tests` is responsible for loading all tests in the
        package.

        The pattern is deliberately not stored as a loader attribute so that
        packages can continue discovery themselves.

        *top_level_dir* is stored internally, and used as a default to any
        nested calls to `discover()`. That is, if a package’s `load_tests`
        calls `loader.discover()`, it does not need to pass this argument.

        *start_dir* can be a dotted module name as well as a directory.

        Added in version 3.2.

        Changed in version 3.4: Modules that raise [`SkipTest`](unittest.md#unittest.SkipTest "unittest.SkipTest") on import are recorded as skips,
        not errors.

        Changed in version 3.4: *start_dir* can be a [namespace packages](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-namespace-package).

        Changed in version 3.4: Paths are sorted before being imported so that execution order is the
        same even if the underlying file system’s ordering is not dependent
        on file name.

        Changed in version 3.5: Found packages are now checked for `load_tests` regardless of
        whether their path matches *pattern*, because it is impossible for
        a package name to match the default pattern.

        Changed in version 3.11: *start_dir* can not be a [namespace packages](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-namespace-package).
        It has been broken since Python 3.7 and Python 3.11 officially remove it.

        Changed in version 3.12.4: *top_level_dir* is only stored for the duration of *discover* call.

    The following attributes of a [`TestLoader`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader "unittest.TestLoader") can be configured either by
    subclassing or assignment on an instance:

    `testMethodPrefix`
    :   String giving the prefix of method names which will be interpreted as test
        methods. The default value is `'test'`.

        This affects [`getTestCaseNames()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader.getTestCaseNames "unittest.TestLoader.getTestCaseNames") and all the `loadTestsFrom*`
        methods.

    `sortTestMethodsUsing`
    :   Function to be used to compare method names when sorting them in
        [`getTestCaseNames()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader.getTestCaseNames "unittest.TestLoader.getTestCaseNames") and all the `loadTestsFrom*` methods.

    `suiteClass`
    :   Callable object that constructs a test suite from a list of tests. No
        methods on the resulting object are needed. The default value is the
        [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") class.

        This affects all the `loadTestsFrom*` methods.

    `testNamePatterns`
    :   List of Unix shell-style wildcard test name patterns that test methods
        have to match to be included in test suites (see `-k` option).

        If this attribute is not `None` (the default), all test methods to be
        included in test suites must match one of the patterns in this list.
        Note that matches are always performed using [`fnmatch.fnmatchcase()`](fnmatch.md#fnmatch.fnmatchcase "fnmatch.fnmatchcase"),
        so unlike patterns passed to the `-k` option, simple substring patterns
        will have to be converted using `*` wildcards.

        This affects all the `loadTestsFrom*` methods.

        Added in version 3.7.

`class unittest.TestResult`
:   This class is used to compile information about which tests have succeeded
    and which have failed.

    A [`TestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") object stores the results of a set of tests. The
    [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") and [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") classes ensure that results are
    properly recorded; test authors do not need to worry about recording the
    outcome of tests.

    Testing frameworks built on top of [`unittest`](unittest.md#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") may want access to the
    [`TestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") object generated by running a set of tests for reporting
    purposes; a [`TestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") instance is returned by the
    `TestRunner.run()` method for this purpose.

    [`TestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") instances have the following attributes that will be of
    interest when inspecting the results of running a set of tests:

    `errors`
    :   A list containing 2-tuples of [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instances and strings
        holding formatted tracebacks. Each tuple represents a test which raised an
        unexpected exception.

    `failures`
    :   A list containing 2-tuples of [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instances and strings
        holding formatted tracebacks. Each tuple represents a test where a failure
        was explicitly signalled using the [assert\* methods](unittest.md#assert-methods).

    `skipped`
    :   A list containing 2-tuples of [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instances and strings
        holding the reason for skipping the test.

        Added in version 3.1.

    `expectedFailures`
    :   A list containing 2-tuples of [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instances and strings
        holding formatted tracebacks. Each tuple represents an expected failure
        or error of the test case.

    `unexpectedSuccesses`
    :   A list containing [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instances that were marked as expected
        failures, but succeeded.

    `collectedDurations`
    :   A list containing 2-tuples of test case names and floats
        representing the elapsed time of each test which was run.

        Added in version 3.12.

    `shouldStop`
    :   Set to `True` when the execution of tests should stop by [`stop()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult.stop "unittest.TestResult.stop").

    `testsRun`
    :   The total number of tests run so far.

    `buffer`
    :   If set to true, `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` will be buffered in between
        [`startTest()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult.startTest "unittest.TestResult.startTest") and [`stopTest()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult.stopTest "unittest.TestResult.stopTest") being called. Collected output will
        only be echoed onto the real `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` if the test
        fails or errors. Any output is also attached to the failure / error message.

        Added in version 3.2.

    `failfast`
    :   If set to true [`stop()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult.stop "unittest.TestResult.stop") will be called on the first failure or error,
        halting the test run.

        Added in version 3.2.

    `tb_locals`
    :   If set to true then local variables will be shown in tracebacks.

        Added in version 3.5.

    `wasSuccessful()`
    :   Return `True` if all tests run so far have passed, otherwise returns
        `False`.

        Changed in version 3.4: Returns `False` if there were any [`unexpectedSuccesses`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult.unexpectedSuccesses "unittest.TestResult.unexpectedSuccesses")
        from tests marked with the [`expectedFailure()`](unittest.md#unittest.expectedFailure "unittest.expectedFailure") decorator.

    `stop()`
    :   This method can be called to signal that the set of tests being run should
        be aborted by setting the [`shouldStop`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult.shouldStop "unittest.TestResult.shouldStop") attribute to `True`.
        `TestRunner` objects should respect this flag and return without
        running any additional tests.

        For example, this feature is used by the [`TextTestRunner`](unittest.md#unittest.TextTestRunner "unittest.TextTestRunner") class to
        stop the test framework when the user signals an interrupt from the
        keyboard. Interactive tools which provide `TestRunner`
        implementations can use this in a similar manner.

    The following methods of the [`TestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") class are used to maintain
    the internal data structures, and may be extended in subclasses to support
    additional reporting requirements. This is particularly useful in building
    tools which support interactive reporting while tests are being run.

    `startTest(test)`
    :   Called when the test case *test* is about to be run.

    `stopTest(test)`
    :   Called after the test case *test* has been executed, regardless of the
        outcome.

    `startTestRun()`
    :   Called once before any tests are executed.

        Added in version 3.1.

    `stopTestRun()`
    :   Called once after all tests are executed.

        Added in version 3.1.

    `addError(test, err)`
    :   Called when the test case *test* raises an unexpected exception. *err* is a
        tuple of the form returned by [`sys.exc_info()`](sys.md#sys.exc_info "sys.exc_info"): `(type, value,
        traceback)`.

        The default implementation appends a tuple `(test, formatted_err)` to
        the instance’s [`errors`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult.errors "unittest.TestResult.errors") attribute, where *formatted_err* is a
        formatted traceback derived from *err*.

    `addFailure(test, err)`
    :   Called when the test case *test* signals a failure. *err* is a tuple of
        the form returned by [`sys.exc_info()`](sys.md#sys.exc_info "sys.exc_info"): `(type, value, traceback)`.

        The default implementation appends a tuple `(test, formatted_err)` to
        the instance’s [`failures`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult.failures "unittest.TestResult.failures") attribute, where *formatted_err* is a
        formatted traceback derived from *err*.

    `addSuccess(test)`
    :   Called when the test case *test* succeeds.

        The default implementation does nothing.

    `addSkip(test, reason)`
    :   Called when the test case *test* is skipped. *reason* is the reason the
        test gave for skipping.

        The default implementation appends a tuple `(test, reason)` to the
        instance’s [`skipped`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult.skipped "unittest.TestResult.skipped") attribute.

    `addExpectedFailure(test, err)`
    :   Called when the test case *test* fails or errors, but was marked with
        the [`expectedFailure()`](unittest.md#unittest.expectedFailure "unittest.expectedFailure") decorator.

        The default implementation appends a tuple `(test, formatted_err)` to
        the instance’s [`expectedFailures`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult.expectedFailures "unittest.TestResult.expectedFailures") attribute, where *formatted_err*
        is a formatted traceback derived from *err*.

    `addUnexpectedSuccess(test)`
    :   Called when the test case *test* was marked with the
        [`expectedFailure()`](unittest.md#unittest.expectedFailure "unittest.expectedFailure") decorator, but succeeded.

        The default implementation appends the test to the instance’s
        [`unexpectedSuccesses`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult.unexpectedSuccesses "unittest.TestResult.unexpectedSuccesses") attribute.

    `addSubTest(test, subtest, outcome)`
    :   Called when a subtest finishes. *test* is the test case
        corresponding to the test method. *subtest* is a custom
        [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instance describing the subtest.

        If *outcome* is [`None`](constants.md#None "None"), the subtest succeeded. Otherwise,
        it failed with an exception where *outcome* is a tuple of the form
        returned by [`sys.exc_info()`](sys.md#sys.exc_info "sys.exc_info"): `(type, value, traceback)`.

        The default implementation does nothing when the outcome is a
        success, and records subtest failures as normal failures.

        Added in version 3.4.

    `addDuration(test, elapsed)`
    :   Called when the test case finishes. *elapsed* is the time represented in
        seconds, and it includes the execution of cleanup functions.

        Added in version 3.12.

`class unittest.TextTestResult(stream, descriptions, verbosity, *, durations=None)`
:   A concrete implementation of [`TestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") used by the
    [`TextTestRunner`](unittest.md#unittest.TextTestRunner "unittest.TextTestRunner"). Subclasses should accept `**kwargs` to ensure
    compatibility as the interface changes.

    Added in version 3.2.

    Changed in version 3.12: Added the *durations* keyword parameter.

`unittest.defaultTestLoader`
:   Instance of the [`TestLoader`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader "unittest.TestLoader") class intended to be shared. If no
    customization of the [`TestLoader`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader "unittest.TestLoader") is needed, this instance can be used
    instead of repeatedly creating new instances.

`class unittest.TextTestRunner(stream=None, descriptions=True, verbosity=1, failfast=False, buffer=False, resultclass=None, warnings=None, *, tb_locals=False, durations=None)`
:   A basic test runner implementation that outputs results to a stream. If *stream*
    is `None`, the default, [`sys.stderr`](sys.md#sys.stderr "sys.stderr") is used as the output stream. This class
    has a few configurable parameters, but is essentially very simple. Graphical
    applications which run test suites should provide alternate implementations. Such
    implementations should accept `**kwargs` as the interface to construct runners
    changes when features are added to unittest.

    By default this runner shows [`DeprecationWarning`](exceptions.md#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning"),
    [`PendingDeprecationWarning`](exceptions.md#PendingDeprecationWarning "PendingDeprecationWarning"), [`ResourceWarning`](exceptions.md#ResourceWarning "ResourceWarning") and
    [`ImportWarning`](exceptions.md#ImportWarning "ImportWarning") even if they are [ignored by default](warnings.md#warning-ignored). This behavior can
    be overridden using Python’s `-Wd` or `-Wa` options
    (see [Warning control](https://docs.python.org/3.12/using/cmdline.html#using-on-warnings)) and leaving
    *warnings* to `None`.

    Changed in version 3.2: Added the *warnings* parameter.

    Changed in version 3.2: The default stream is set to [`sys.stderr`](sys.md#sys.stderr "sys.stderr") at instantiation time rather
    than import time.

    Changed in version 3.5: Added the *tb_locals* parameter.

    Changed in version 3.12: Added the *durations* parameter.

    `_makeResult()`
    :   This method returns the instance of `TestResult` used by [`run()`](unittest.md#unittest.TextTestRunner.run "unittest.TextTestRunner.run").
        It is not intended to be called directly, but can be overridden in
        subclasses to provide a custom `TestResult`.

        `_makeResult()` instantiates the class or callable passed in the
        `TextTestRunner` constructor as the `resultclass` argument. It
        defaults to [`TextTestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TextTestResult "unittest.TextTestResult") if no `resultclass` is provided.
        The result class is instantiated with the following arguments:

        ```python3
        stream, descriptions, verbosity
        ```

    `run(test)`
    :   This method is the main public interface to the `TextTestRunner`. This
        method takes a [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") or [`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") instance. A
        [`TestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") is created by calling
        [`_makeResult()`](unittest.md#unittest.TextTestRunner._makeResult "unittest.TextTestRunner._makeResult") and the test(s) are run and the
        results printed to stdout.

`unittest.main(module='__main__', defaultTest=None, argv=None, testRunner=None, testLoader=unittest.defaultTestLoader, exit=True, verbosity=1, failfast=None, catchbreak=None, buffer=None, warnings=None)`
:   A command-line program that loads a set of tests from *module* and runs them;
    this is primarily for making test modules conveniently executable.
    The simplest use for this function is to include the following line at the
    end of a test script:

    ```python3
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    ```

    You can run tests with more detailed information by passing in the verbosity
    argument:

    ```python3
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main(verbosity=2)
    ```

    The *defaultTest* argument is either the name of a single test or an
    iterable of test names to run if no test names are specified via *argv*. If
    not specified or `None` and no test names are provided via *argv*, all
    tests found in *module* are run.

    The *argv* argument can be a list of options passed to the program, with the
    first element being the program name. If not specified or `None`,
    the values of [`sys.argv`](sys.md#sys.argv "sys.argv") are used.

    The *testRunner* argument can either be a test runner class or an already
    created instance of it. By default `main` calls [`sys.exit()`](sys.md#sys.exit "sys.exit") with
    an exit code indicating success (0) or failure (1) of the tests run.
    An exit code of 5 indicates that no tests were run or skipped.

    The *testLoader* argument has to be a [`TestLoader`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader "unittest.TestLoader") instance,
    and defaults to [`defaultTestLoader`](unittest.md#unittest.defaultTestLoader "unittest.defaultTestLoader").

    `main` supports being used from the interactive interpreter by passing in the
    argument `exit=False`. This displays the result on standard output without
    calling [`sys.exit()`](sys.md#sys.exit "sys.exit"):

    ```python3
    >>> from unittest import main
    >>> main(module='test_module', exit=False)
    ```

    The *failfast*, *catchbreak* and *buffer* parameters have the same
    effect as the same-name [command-line options](unittest.md#command-line-options).

    The *warnings* argument specifies the [warning filter](warnings.md#warning-filter)
    that should be used while running the tests. If it’s not specified, it will
    remain `None` if a `-W` option is passed to **python**
    (see [Warning control](https://docs.python.org/3.12/using/cmdline.html#using-on-warnings)),
    otherwise it will be set to `'default'`.

    Calling `main` returns an object with the `result` attribute that contains
    the result of the tests run as a [`unittest.TestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult").

    Changed in version 3.1: The *exit* parameter was added.

    Changed in version 3.2: The *verbosity*, *failfast*, *catchbreak*, *buffer*
    and *warnings* parameters were added.

    Changed in version 3.4: The *defaultTest* parameter was changed to also accept an iterable of
    test names.

#### load_tests Protocol

Added in version 3.2.

Modules or packages can customize how tests are loaded from them during normal
test runs or test discovery by implementing a function called `load_tests`.

If a test module defines `load_tests` it will be called by
[`TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule "unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule") with the following arguments:

```python3
load_tests(loader, standard_tests, pattern)
```

where *pattern* is passed straight through from `loadTestsFromModule`. It
defaults to `None`.

It should return a [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite").

*loader* is the instance of [`TestLoader`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader "unittest.TestLoader") doing the loading.
*standard_tests* are the tests that would be loaded by default from the
module. It is common for test modules to only want to add or remove tests
from the standard set of tests.
The third argument is used when loading packages as part of test discovery.

A typical `load_tests` function that loads tests from a specific set of
[`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") classes may look like:

```python3
test_cases = (TestCase1, TestCase2, TestCase3)

def load_tests(loader, tests, pattern):
    suite = TestSuite()
    for test_class in test_cases:
        tests = loader.loadTestsFromTestCase(test_class)
        suite.addTests(tests)
    return suite
```

If discovery is started in a directory containing a package, either from the
command line or by calling [`TestLoader.discover()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestLoader.discover "unittest.TestLoader.discover"), then the package
`__init__.py` will be checked for `load_tests`. If that function does
not exist, discovery will recurse into the package as though it were just
another directory. Otherwise, discovery of the package’s tests will be left up
to `load_tests` which is called with the following arguments:

```python3
load_tests(loader, standard_tests, pattern)
```

This should return a [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite") representing all the tests
from the package. (`standard_tests` will only contain tests
collected from `__init__.py`.)

Because the pattern is passed into `load_tests` the package is free to
continue (and potentially modify) test discovery. A ‘do nothing’
`load_tests` function for a test package would look like:

```python3
def load_tests(loader, standard_tests, pattern):
    # top level directory cached on loader instance
    this_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    package_tests = loader.discover(start_dir=this_dir, pattern=pattern)
    standard_tests.addTests(package_tests)
    return standard_tests
```

Changed in version 3.5: Discovery no longer checks package names for matching *pattern* due to the
impossibility of package names matching the default pattern.

## Class and Module Fixtures

Class and module level fixtures are implemented in [`TestSuite`](unittest.md#unittest.TestSuite "unittest.TestSuite"). When
the test suite encounters a test from a new class then `tearDownClass()`
from the previous class (if there is one) is called, followed by
`setUpClass()` from the new class.

Similarly if a test is from a different module from the previous test then
`tearDownModule` from the previous module is run, followed by
`setUpModule` from the new module.

After all the tests have run the final `tearDownClass` and
`tearDownModule` are run.

Note that shared fixtures do not play well with [potential] features like test
parallelization and they break test isolation. They should be used with care.

The default ordering of tests created by the unittest test loaders is to group
all tests from the same modules and classes together. This will lead to
`setUpClass` / `setUpModule` (etc) being called exactly once per class and
module. If you randomize the order, so that tests from different modules and
classes are adjacent to each other, then these shared fixture functions may be
called multiple times in a single test run.

Shared fixtures are not intended to work with suites with non-standard
ordering. A `BaseTestSuite` still exists for frameworks that don’t want to
support shared fixtures.

If there are any exceptions raised during one of the shared fixture functions
the test is reported as an error. Because there is no corresponding test
instance an `_ErrorHolder` object (that has the same interface as a
[`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase")) is created to represent the error. If you are just using
the standard unittest test runner then this detail doesn’t matter, but if you
are a framework author it may be relevant.

### setUpClass and tearDownClass

These must be implemented as class methods:

```python3
import unittest

class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls._connection = createExpensiveConnectionObject()

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        cls._connection.destroy()
```

If you want the `setUpClass` and `tearDownClass` on base classes called
then you must call up to them yourself. The implementations in
[`TestCase`](unittest.md#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") are empty.

If an exception is raised during a `setUpClass` then the tests in the class
are not run and the `tearDownClass` is not run. Skipped classes will not
have `setUpClass` or `tearDownClass` run. If the exception is a
[`SkipTest`](unittest.md#unittest.SkipTest "unittest.SkipTest") exception then the class will be reported as having been skipped
instead of as an error.

### setUpModule and tearDownModule

These should be implemented as functions:

```python3
def setUpModule():
    createConnection()

def tearDownModule():
    closeConnection()
```

If an exception is raised in a `setUpModule` then none of the tests in the
module will be run and the `tearDownModule` will not be run. If the exception is a
[`SkipTest`](unittest.md#unittest.SkipTest "unittest.SkipTest") exception then the module will be reported as having been skipped
instead of as an error.

To add cleanup code that must be run even in the case of an exception, use
`addModuleCleanup`:

`unittest.addModuleCleanup(function, /, *args, **kwargs)`
:   Add a function to be called after `tearDownModule()` to cleanup
    resources used during the test class. Functions will be called in reverse
    order to the order they are added (LIFO).
    They are called with any arguments and keyword arguments passed into
    [`addModuleCleanup()`](unittest.md#unittest.addModuleCleanup "unittest.addModuleCleanup") when they are added.

    If `setUpModule()` fails, meaning that `tearDownModule()` is not
    called, then any cleanup functions added will still be called.

    Added in version 3.8.

`classmethod unittest.enterModuleContext(cm)`
:   Enter the supplied [context manager](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-context-manager). If successful, also
    add its [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") method as a cleanup function by
    [`addModuleCleanup()`](unittest.md#unittest.addModuleCleanup "unittest.addModuleCleanup") and return the result of the
    [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") method.

    Added in version 3.11.

`unittest.doModuleCleanups()`
:   This function is called unconditionally after `tearDownModule()`, or
    after `setUpModule()` if `setUpModule()` raises an exception.

    It is responsible for calling all the cleanup functions added by
    [`addModuleCleanup()`](unittest.md#unittest.addModuleCleanup "unittest.addModuleCleanup"). If you need cleanup functions to be called
    *prior* to `tearDownModule()` then you can call
    [`doModuleCleanups()`](unittest.md#unittest.doModuleCleanups "unittest.doModuleCleanups") yourself.

    [`doModuleCleanups()`](unittest.md#unittest.doModuleCleanups "unittest.doModuleCleanups") pops methods off the stack of cleanup
    functions one at a time, so it can be called at any time.

    Added in version 3.8.

## Signal Handling

Added in version 3.2.

The [`-c/--catch`](unittest.md#cmdoption-unittest-c) command-line option to unittest,
along with the `catchbreak` parameter to [`unittest.main()`](unittest.md#unittest.main "unittest.main"), provide
more friendly handling of control-C during a test run. With catch break
behavior enabled control-C will allow the currently running test to complete,
and the test run will then end and report all the results so far. A second
control-c will raise a [`KeyboardInterrupt`](exceptions.md#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt") in the usual way.

The control-c handling signal handler attempts to remain compatible with code or
tests that install their own [`signal.SIGINT`](signal.md#signal.SIGINT "signal.SIGINT") handler. If the `unittest`
handler is called but *isn’t* the installed [`signal.SIGINT`](signal.md#signal.SIGINT "signal.SIGINT") handler,
i.e. it has been replaced by the system under test and delegated to, then it
calls the default handler. This will normally be the expected behavior by code
that replaces an installed handler and delegates to it. For individual tests
that need `unittest` control-c handling disabled the [`removeHandler()`](unittest.md#unittest.removeHandler "unittest.removeHandler")
decorator can be used.

There are a few utility functions for framework authors to enable control-c
handling functionality within test frameworks.

`unittest.installHandler()`
:   Install the control-c handler. When a [`signal.SIGINT`](signal.md#signal.SIGINT "signal.SIGINT") is received
    (usually in response to the user pressing control-c) all registered results
    have [`stop()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult.stop "unittest.TestResult.stop") called.

`unittest.registerResult(result)`
:   Register a [`TestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") object for control-c handling. Registering a
    result stores a weak reference to it, so it doesn’t prevent the result from
    being garbage collected.

    Registering a [`TestResult`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult "unittest.TestResult") object has no side-effects if control-c
    handling is not enabled, so test frameworks can unconditionally register
    all results they create independently of whether or not handling is enabled.

`unittest.removeResult(result)`
:   Remove a registered result. Once a result has been removed then
    [`stop()`](unittest.md#unittest.TestResult.stop "unittest.TestResult.stop") will no longer be called on that result object in
    response to a control-c.

`unittest.removeHandler(function=None)`
:   When called without arguments this function removes the control-c handler
    if it has been installed. This function can also be used as a test decorator
    to temporarily remove the handler while the test is being executed:

    ```python3
    @unittest.removeHandler
    def test_signal_handling(self):
        ...
    ```
