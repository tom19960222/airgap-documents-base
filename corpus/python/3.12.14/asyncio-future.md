*Future* objects are used to bridge **low-level callback-based code**
with high-level async/await code.

## Future Functions

`asyncio.isfuture(obj)`
:   Return `True` if *obj* is either of:

    - an instance of [`asyncio.Future`](asyncio-future.md#asyncio.Future "asyncio.Future"),
    - an instance of [`asyncio.Task`](asyncio-task.md#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task"),
    - a Future-like object with a `_asyncio_future_blocking`
      attribute.

    Added in version 3.5.

`asyncio.ensure_future(obj, *, loop=None)`
:   Return:

    - *obj* argument as is, if *obj* is a [`Future`](asyncio-future.md#asyncio.Future "asyncio.Future"),
      a [`Task`](asyncio-task.md#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task"), or a Future-like object ([`isfuture()`](asyncio-future.md#asyncio.isfuture "asyncio.isfuture")
      is used for the test.)
    - a [`Task`](asyncio-task.md#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task") object wrapping *obj*, if *obj* is a
      coroutine ([`iscoroutine()`](asyncio-task.md#asyncio.iscoroutine "asyncio.iscoroutine") is used for the test);
      in this case the coroutine will be scheduled by
      `ensure_future()`.
    - a [`Task`](asyncio-task.md#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task") object that would await on *obj*, if *obj* is an
      awaitable ([`inspect.isawaitable()`](inspect.md#inspect.isawaitable "inspect.isawaitable") is used for the test.)

    If *obj* is neither of the above a [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError "TypeError") is raised.

    > **Important:**
    >
    > See also the [`create_task()`](asyncio-task.md#asyncio.create_task "asyncio.create_task") function which is the
    > preferred way for creating new Tasks.
    >
    > Save a reference to the result of this function, to avoid
    > a task disappearing mid-execution.

    Changed in version 3.5.1: The function accepts any [awaitable](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-awaitable) object.

    Deprecated since version 3.10: Deprecation warning is emitted if *obj* is not a Future-like object
    and *loop* is not specified and there is no running event loop.

`asyncio.wrap_future(future, *, loop=None)`
:   Wrap a [`concurrent.futures.Future`](concurrent.futures.md#concurrent.futures.Future "concurrent.futures.Future") object in a
    [`asyncio.Future`](asyncio-future.md#asyncio.Future "asyncio.Future") object.

    Deprecated since version 3.10: Deprecation warning is emitted if *future* is not a Future-like object
    and *loop* is not specified and there is no running event loop.

## Future Object

`class asyncio.Future(*, loop=None)`
:   A Future represents an eventual result of an asynchronous
    operation. Not thread-safe.

    Future is an [awaitable](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-awaitable) object. Coroutines can await on
    Future objects until they either have a result or an exception
    set, or until they are cancelled. A Future can be awaited multiple
    times and the result is same.

    Typically Futures are used to enable low-level
    callback-based code (e.g. in protocols implemented using asyncio
    [transports](asyncio-protocol.md#asyncio-transports-protocols))
    to interoperate with high-level async/await code.

    The rule of thumb is to never expose Future objects in user-facing
    APIs, and the recommended way to create a Future object is to call
    [`loop.create_future()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.create_future "asyncio.loop.create_future"). This way alternative event loop
    implementations can inject their own optimized implementations
    of a Future object.

    Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the [`contextvars`](contextvars.md#module-contextvars "contextvars: Context Variables") module.

    Deprecated since version 3.10: Deprecation warning is emitted if *loop* is not specified
    and there is no running event loop.

    `result()`
    :   Return the result of the Future.

        If the Future is *done* and has a result set by the
        [`set_result()`](asyncio-future.md#asyncio.Future.set_result "asyncio.Future.set_result") method, the result value is returned.

        If the Future is *done* and has an exception set by the
        [`set_exception()`](asyncio-future.md#asyncio.Future.set_exception "asyncio.Future.set_exception") method, this method raises the exception.

        If the Future has been *cancelled*, this method raises
        a [`CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.md#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") exception.

        If the Future’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises
        an [`InvalidStateError`](asyncio-exceptions.md#asyncio.InvalidStateError "asyncio.InvalidStateError") exception.

    `set_result(result)`
    :   Mark the Future as *done* and set its result.

        Raises an [`InvalidStateError`](asyncio-exceptions.md#asyncio.InvalidStateError "asyncio.InvalidStateError") error if the Future is
        already *done*.

    `set_exception(exception)`
    :   Mark the Future as *done* and set an exception.

        Raises an [`InvalidStateError`](asyncio-exceptions.md#asyncio.InvalidStateError "asyncio.InvalidStateError") error if the Future is
        already *done*.

    `done()`
    :   Return `True` if the Future is *done*.

        A Future is *done* if it was *cancelled* or if it has a result
        or an exception set with [`set_result()`](asyncio-future.md#asyncio.Future.set_result "asyncio.Future.set_result") or
        [`set_exception()`](asyncio-future.md#asyncio.Future.set_exception "asyncio.Future.set_exception") calls.

    `cancelled()`
    :   Return `True` if the Future was *cancelled*.

        The method is usually used to check if a Future is not
        *cancelled* before setting a result or an exception for it:

        ```python3
        if not fut.cancelled():
            fut.set_result(42)
        ```

    `add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)`
    :   Add a callback to be run when the Future is *done*.

        The *callback* is called with the Future object as its only
        argument.

        If the Future is already *done* when this method is called,
        the callback is scheduled with [`loop.call_soon()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.call_soon "asyncio.loop.call_soon").

        An optional keyword-only *context* argument allows specifying a
        custom [`contextvars.Context`](contextvars.md#contextvars.Context "contextvars.Context") for the *callback* to run in.
        The current context is used when no *context* is provided.

        [`functools.partial()`](functools.md#functools.partial "functools.partial") can be used to pass parameters
        to the callback, e.g.:

        ```python3
        # Call 'print("Future:", fut)' when "fut" is done.
        fut.add_done_callback(
            functools.partial(print, "Future:"))
        ```

        Changed in version 3.7: The *context* keyword-only parameter was added.
        See [**PEP 567**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0567/) for more details.

    `remove_done_callback(callback)`
    :   Remove *callback* from the callbacks list.

        Returns the number of callbacks removed, which is typically 1,
        unless a callback was added more than once.

    `cancel(msg=None)`
    :   Cancel the Future and schedule callbacks.

        If the Future is already *done* or *cancelled*, return `False`.
        Otherwise, change the Future’s state to *cancelled*,
        schedule the callbacks, and return `True`.

        Changed in version 3.9: Added the *msg* parameter.

    `exception()`
    :   Return the exception that was set on this Future.

        The exception (or `None` if no exception was set) is
        returned only if the Future is *done*.

        If the Future has been *cancelled*, this method raises a
        [`CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.md#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") exception.

        If the Future isn’t *done* yet, this method raises an
        [`InvalidStateError`](asyncio-exceptions.md#asyncio.InvalidStateError "asyncio.InvalidStateError") exception.

    `get_loop()`
    :   Return the event loop the Future object is bound to.

        Added in version 3.7.

This example creates a Future object, creates and schedules an
asynchronous Task to set result for the Future, and waits until
the Future has a result:

```python3
async def set_after(fut, delay, value):
    # Sleep for *delay* seconds.
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)

    # Set *value* as a result of *fut* Future.
    fut.set_result(value)

async def main():
    # Get the current event loop.
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()

    # Create a new Future object.
    fut = loop.create_future()

    # Run "set_after()" coroutine in a parallel Task.
    # We are using the low-level "loop.create_task()" API here because
    # we already have a reference to the event loop at hand.
    # Otherwise we could have just used "asyncio.create_task()".
    loop.create_task(
        set_after(fut, 1, '... world'))

    print('hello ...')

    # Wait until *fut* has a result (1 second) and print it.
    print(await fut)

asyncio.run(main())
```
