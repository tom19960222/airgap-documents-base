# `importlib.metadata` – Accessing package metadata

Added in version 3.8.

Changed in version 3.10: `importlib.metadata` is no longer provisional.

**Source code:** [Lib/importlib/metadata/__init__.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/importlib/metadata/__init__.py)

`importlib.metadata` is a library that provides access to
the metadata of an installed [Distribution Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package),
such as its entry points
or its top-level names ([Import Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Import-Package)s, modules, if any).
Built in part on Python’s import system, this library
intends to replace similar functionality in the [entry point
API](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#entry-points) and [metadata API](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#metadata-api) of `pkg_resources`. Along with
[`importlib.resources`](importlib.resources.md#module-importlib.resources "importlib.resources: Package resource reading, opening, and access"),
this package can eliminate the need to use the older and less efficient
`pkg_resources` package.

`importlib.metadata` operates on third-party *distribution packages*
installed into Python’s `site-packages` directory via tools such as
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
Specifically, it works with distributions with discoverable
`dist-info` or `egg-info` directories,
and metadata defined by the [Core metadata specifications](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#core-metadata).

> **Important:**
>
> These are *not* necessarily equivalent to or correspond 1:1 with
> the top-level *import package* names
> that can be imported inside Python code.
> One *distribution package* can contain multiple *import packages*
> (and single modules),
> and one top-level *import package*
> may map to multiple *distribution packages*
> if it is a namespace package.
> You can use [package_distributions()](importlib.metadata.md#package-distributions)
> to get a mapping between them.

By default, distribution metadata can live on the file system
or in zip archives on
[`sys.path`](sys.md#sys.path "sys.path"). Through an extension mechanism, the metadata can live almost
anywhere.

## Overview

Let’s say you wanted to get the version string for a
[Distribution Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package) you’ve installed
using `pip`. We start by creating a virtual environment and installing
something into it:

```shell-session
$ python -m venv example
$ source example/bin/activate
(example) $ python -m pip install wheel
```

You can get the version string for `wheel` by running the following:

```pycon
(example) $ python
>>> from importlib.metadata import version
>>> version('wheel')
'0.32.3'
```

You can also get a collection of entry points selectable by properties of the EntryPoint (typically ‘group’ or ‘name’), such as
`console_scripts`, `distutils.commands` and others. Each group contains a
collection of [EntryPoint](importlib.metadata.md#entry-points) objects.

You can get the [metadata for a distribution](importlib.metadata.md#metadata):

```python3
>>> list(metadata('wheel'))
['Metadata-Version', 'Name', 'Version', 'Summary', 'Home-page', 'Author', 'Author-email', 'Maintainer', 'Maintainer-email', 'License', 'Project-URL', 'Project-URL', 'Project-URL', 'Keywords', 'Platform', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Requires-Python', 'Provides-Extra', 'Requires-Dist', 'Requires-Dist']
```

You can also get a [distribution’s version number](importlib.metadata.md#version), list its
[constituent files](importlib.metadata.md#files), and get a list of the distribution’s
[Distribution requirements](importlib.metadata.md#requirements).

*exception* importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError
:   Subclass of [`ModuleNotFoundError`](exceptions.md#ModuleNotFoundError "ModuleNotFoundError") raised by several functions in this
    module when queried for a distribution package which is not installed in the
    current Python environment.

## Functional API

This package provides the following functionality via its public API.

### Entry points

importlib.metadata.entry_points(*\*\*select_params*)
:   Returns a [`EntryPoints`](importlib.metadata.md#importlib.metadata.EntryPoints "importlib.metadata.EntryPoints") instance describing entry points for the
    current environment. Any given keyword parameters are passed to the
    `select()` method for comparison to the attributes of
    the individual entry point definitions.

    Note: it is not currently possible to query for entry points based on
    their `EntryPoint.dist` attribute (as different `Distribution`
    instances do not currently compare equal, even if they have the same attributes)

*class* importlib.metadata.EntryPoints
:   Details of a collection of installed entry points.

    Also provides a `.groups` attribute that reports all identified entry
    point groups, and a `.names` attribute that reports all identified entry
    point names.

*class* importlib.metadata.EntryPoint
:   Details of an installed entry point.

    Each `EntryPoint` instance has `.name`, `.group`, and `.value`
    attributes and a `.load()` method to resolve the value. There are also
    `.module`, `.attr`, and `.extras` attributes for getting the
    components of the `.value` attribute, and `.dist` for obtaining
    information regarding the distribution package that provides the entry point.

Query all entry points:

```python3
>>> eps = entry_points()
```

The `entry_points()` function returns a `EntryPoints` object,
a collection of all `EntryPoint` objects with `names` and `groups`
attributes for convenience:

```python3
>>> sorted(eps.groups)
['console_scripts', 'distutils.commands', 'distutils.setup_keywords', 'egg_info.writers', 'setuptools.installation']
```

`EntryPoints` has a `select()` method to select entry points
matching specific properties. Select entry points in the
`console_scripts` group:

```python3
>>> scripts = eps.select(group='console_scripts')
```

Equivalently, since `entry_points()` passes keyword arguments
through to select:

```python3
>>> scripts = entry_points(group='console_scripts')
```

Pick out a specific script named “wheel” (found in the wheel project):

```python3
>>> 'wheel' in scripts.names
True
>>> wheel = scripts['wheel']
```

Equivalently, query for that entry point during selection:

```python3
>>> (wheel,) = entry_points(group='console_scripts', name='wheel')
>>> (wheel,) = entry_points().select(group='console_scripts', name='wheel')
```

Inspect the resolved entry point:

```python3
>>> wheel
EntryPoint(name='wheel', value='wheel.cli:main', group='console_scripts')
>>> wheel.module
'wheel.cli'
>>> wheel.attr
'main'
>>> wheel.extras
[]
>>> main = wheel.load()
>>> main
<function main at 0x103528488>
```

The `group` and `name` are arbitrary values defined by the package author
and usually a client will wish to resolve all entry points for a particular
group. Read [the setuptools docs](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html)
for more information on entry points, their definition, and usage.

*Compatibility Note*

The “selectable” entry points were introduced in `importlib_metadata`
3.6 and Python 3.10. Prior to those changes, `entry_points` accepted
no parameters and always returned a dictionary of entry points, keyed
by group. With `importlib_metadata` 5.0 and Python 3.12,
`entry_points` always returns an `EntryPoints` object. See
[backports.entry_points_selectable](https://pypi.org/project/backports.entry_points_selectable/)
for compatibility options.

### Distribution metadata

importlib.metadata.metadata(*distribution_name*)
:   Return the distribution metadata corresponding to the named
    distribution package as a [`PackageMetadata`](importlib.metadata.md#importlib.metadata.PackageMetadata "importlib.metadata.PackageMetadata") instance.

    Raises [`PackageNotFoundError`](importlib.metadata.md#importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError "importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError") if the named distribution
    package is not installed in the current Python environment.

*class* importlib.metadata.PackageMetadata
:   A concrete implementation of the
    [PackageMetadata protocol](https://importlib-metadata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#importlib_metadata.PackageMetadata).

    In addition to providing the defined protocol methods and attributes, subscripting
    the instance is equivalent to calling the `get()` method.

Every [Distribution Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package)
includes some metadata, which you can extract using the `metadata()` function:

```python3
>>> wheel_metadata = metadata('wheel')
```

The keys of the returned data structure name the metadata keywords, and
the values are returned unparsed from the distribution metadata:

```python3
>>> wheel_metadata['Requires-Python']
'>=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*'
```

[`PackageMetadata`](importlib.metadata.md#importlib.metadata.PackageMetadata "importlib.metadata.PackageMetadata") also presents a `json` attribute that returns
all the metadata in a JSON-compatible form per [**PEP 566**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0566/):

```python3
>>> wheel_metadata.json['requires_python']
'>=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*'
```

The full set of available metadata is not described here.
See the PyPA [Core metadata specification](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#core-metadata) for additional details.

Changed in version 3.10: The `Description` is now included in the metadata when presented
through the payload. Line continuation characters have been removed.

The `json` attribute was added.

### Distribution versions

importlib.metadata.version(*distribution_name*)
:   Return the installed distribution package
    [version](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#version)
    for the named distribution package.

    Raises [`PackageNotFoundError`](importlib.metadata.md#importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError "importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError") if the named distribution
    package is not installed in the current Python environment.

The `version()` function is the quickest way to get a
[Distribution Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package)’s version
number, as a string:

```python3
>>> version('wheel')
'0.32.3'
```

### Distribution files

importlib.metadata.files(*distribution_name*)
:   Return the full set of files contained within the named
    distribution package.

    Raises [`PackageNotFoundError`](importlib.metadata.md#importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError "importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError") if the named distribution
    package is not installed in the current Python environment.

    Returns [`None`](constants.md#None "None") if the distribution is found but the installation
    database records reporting the files associated with the distribuion package
    are missing.

*class* importlib.metadata.PackagePath
:   A [`pathlib.PurePath`](pathlib.md#pathlib.PurePath "pathlib.PurePath") derived object with additional `dist`,
    `size`, and `hash` properties corresponding to the distribution
    package’s installation metadata for that file.

The `files()` function takes a
[Distribution Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package)
name and returns all of the files installed by this distribution. Each file is reported
as a [`PackagePath`](importlib.metadata.md#importlib.metadata.PackagePath "importlib.metadata.PackagePath") instance. For example:

```python3
>>> util = [p for p in files('wheel') if 'util.py' in str(p)][0]
>>> util
PackagePath('wheel/util.py')
>>> util.size
859
>>> util.dist
<importlib.metadata._hooks.PathDistribution object at 0x101e0cef0>
>>> util.hash
<FileHash mode: sha256 value: bYkw5oMccfazVCoYQwKkkemoVyMAFoR34mmKBx8R1NI>
```

Once you have the file, you can also read its contents:

```python3
>>> print(util.read_text())
import base64
import sys
...
def as_bytes(s):
    if isinstance(s, text_type):
        return s.encode('utf-8')
    return s
```

You can also use the `locate()` method to get the absolute
path to the file:

```python3
>>> util.locate()
PosixPath('/home/gustav/example/lib/site-packages/wheel/util.py')
```

In the case where the metadata file listing files
(`RECORD` or `SOURCES.txt`) is missing, `files()` will
return [`None`](constants.md#None "None"). The caller may wish to wrap calls to
`files()` in [always_iterable](https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#more_itertools.always_iterable)
or otherwise guard against this condition if the target
distribution is not known to have the metadata present.

### Distribution requirements

importlib.metadata.requires(*distribution_name*)
:   Return the declared dependency specifiers for the named
    distribution package.

    Raises [`PackageNotFoundError`](importlib.metadata.md#importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError "importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError") if the named distribution
    package is not installed in the current Python environment.

To get the full set of requirements for a [Distribution Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package),
use the `requires()`
function:

```python3
>>> requires('wheel')
["pytest (>=3.0.0) ; extra == 'test'", "pytest-cov ; extra == 'test'"]
```

### Mapping import to distribution packages

importlib.metadata.packages_distributions()
:   Return a mapping from the top level module and import package
    names found via [`sys.meta_path`](sys.md#sys.meta_path "sys.meta_path") to the names of the distribution
    packages (if any) that provide the corresponding files.

    To allow for namespace packages (which may have members provided by
    multiple distribution packages), each top level import name maps to a
    list of distribution names rather than mapping directly to a single name.

A convenience method to resolve the [Distribution Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package)
name (or names, in the case of a namespace package)
that provide each importable top-level
Python module or [Import Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Import-Package):

```python3
>>> packages_distributions()
{'importlib_metadata': ['importlib-metadata'], 'yaml': ['PyYAML'], 'jaraco': ['jaraco.classes', 'jaraco.functools'], ...}
```

Some editable installs, [do not supply top-level names](https://github.com/pypa/packaging-problems/issues/609), and thus this
function is not reliable with such installs.

Added in version 3.10.

## Distributions

importlib.metadata.distribution(*distribution_name*)
:   Return a [`Distribution`](importlib.metadata.md#importlib.metadata.Distribution "importlib.metadata.Distribution") instance describing the named
    distribution package.

    Raises [`PackageNotFoundError`](importlib.metadata.md#importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError "importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError") if the named distribution
    package is not installed in the current Python environment.

*class* importlib.metadata.Distribution
:   Details of an installed distribution package.

    Note: different `Distribution` instances do not currently compare
    equal, even if they relate to the same installed distribution and
    accordingly have the same attributes.

While the module level API described above is the most common and convenient usage,
you can get all of that information from the `Distribution` class.
`Distribution` is an abstract object that represents the metadata for
a Python [Distribution Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package).
You can get the concrete `Distribution` subclass instance for an installed
distribution package by calling the [`distribution()`](importlib.metadata.md#importlib.metadata.distribution "importlib.metadata.distribution") function:

```python3
>>> from importlib.metadata import distribution
>>> dist = distribution('wheel')
>>> type(dist)
<class 'importlib.metadata.PathDistribution'>
```

Thus, an alternative way to get the version number is through the
`Distribution` instance:

```python3
>>> dist.version
'0.32.3'
```

There are all kinds of additional metadata available on `Distribution`
instances:

```python3
>>> dist.metadata['Requires-Python']
'>=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*'
>>> dist.metadata['License']
'MIT'
```

The full set of available metadata is not described here.
See the PyPA [Core metadata specification](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#core-metadata) for additional details.

## Distribution Discovery

By default, this package provides built-in support for discovery of metadata
for file system and zip file [Distribution Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package)s.
This metadata finder search defaults to `sys.path`, but varies slightly in how it interprets those values from how other import machinery does. In particular:

- `importlib.metadata` does not honor [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes "bytes") objects on `sys.path`.
- `importlib.metadata` will incidentally honor [`pathlib.Path`](pathlib.md#pathlib.Path "pathlib.Path") objects on `sys.path` even though such values will be ignored for imports.

## Extending the search algorithm

Because [Distribution Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package) metadata
is not available through [`sys.path`](sys.md#sys.path "sys.path") searches, or
package loaders directly,
the metadata for a distribution is found through import
system [finders](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/import.html#finders-and-loaders). To find a distribution package’s metadata,
`importlib.metadata` queries the list of [meta path finders](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-meta-path-finder) on
[`sys.meta_path`](sys.md#sys.meta_path "sys.meta_path").

By default `importlib.metadata` installs a finder for distribution packages
found on the file system.
This finder doesn’t actually find any *distributions*,
but it can find their metadata.

The abstract class [`importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder`](importlib.md#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder "importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder") defines the
interface expected of finders by Python’s import system.
`importlib.metadata` extends this protocol by looking for an optional
`find_distributions` callable on the finders from
[`sys.meta_path`](sys.md#sys.meta_path "sys.meta_path") and presents this extended interface as the
`DistributionFinder` abstract base class, which defines this abstract
method:

```python3
@abc.abstractmethod
def find_distributions(context=DistributionFinder.Context()):
    """Return an iterable of all Distribution instances capable of
    loading the metadata for packages for the indicated ``context``.
    """
```

The `DistributionFinder.Context` object provides `.path` and `.name`
properties indicating the path to search and name to match and may
supply other relevant context.

What this means in practice is that to support finding distribution package
metadata in locations other than the file system, subclass
`Distribution` and implement the abstract methods. Then from
a custom finder, return instances of this derived `Distribution` in the
`find_distributions()` method.
