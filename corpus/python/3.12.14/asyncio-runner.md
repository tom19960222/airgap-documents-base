# Runners

**Source code:** [Lib/asyncio/runners.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/asyncio/runners.py)

This section outlines high-level asyncio primitives to run asyncio code.

They are built on top of an [event loop](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio-event-loop) with the aim
to simplify async code usage for common wide-spread scenarios.

- [Running an asyncio Program](asyncio-runner.md#running-an-asyncio-program)
- [Runner context manager](asyncio-runner.md#runner-context-manager)
- [Handling Keyboard Interruption](asyncio-runner.md#handling-keyboard-interruption)

## Running an asyncio Program

asyncio.run(*coro*, *\**, *debug=None*, *loop_factory=None*)
:   Execute the [coroutine](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-coroutine) *coro* and return the result.

    This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of
    managing the asyncio event loop, *finalizing asynchronous
    generators*, and closing the executor.

    This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is
    running in the same thread.

    If *debug* is `True`, the event loop will be run in debug mode. `False` disables
    debug mode explicitly. `None` is used to respect the global
    [Debug Mode](asyncio-dev.md#asyncio-debug-mode) settings.

    If *loop_factory* is not `None`, it is used to create a new event loop;
    otherwise [`asyncio.new_event_loop()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.new_event_loop "asyncio.new_event_loop") is used. The loop is closed at the end.
    This function should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs,
    and should ideally only be called once. It is recommended to use
    *loop_factory* to configure the event loop instead of policies.

    The executor is given a timeout duration of 5 minutes to shutdown.
    If the executor hasn’t finished within that duration, a warning is
    emitted and the executor is closed.

    Example:

    ```python3
    async def main():
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print('hello')

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    Added in version 3.7.

    Changed in version 3.9: Updated to use [`loop.shutdown_default_executor()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.shutdown_default_executor "asyncio.loop.shutdown_default_executor").

    Changed in version 3.10: *debug* is `None` by default to respect the global debug mode settings.

    Changed in version 3.12: Added *loop_factory* parameter.

## Runner context manager

*class* asyncio.Runner(*\**, *debug=None*, *loop_factory=None*)
:   A context manager that simplifies *multiple* async function calls in the same
    context.

    Sometimes several top-level async functions should be called in the same [event
    loop](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio-event-loop) and [`contextvars.Context`](contextvars.md#contextvars.Context "contextvars.Context").

    If *debug* is `True`, the event loop will be run in debug mode. `False` disables
    debug mode explicitly. `None` is used to respect the global
    [Debug Mode](asyncio-dev.md#asyncio-debug-mode) settings.

    *loop_factory* could be used for overriding the loop creation.
    It is the responsibility of the *loop_factory* to set the created loop as the
    current one. By default [`asyncio.new_event_loop()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.new_event_loop "asyncio.new_event_loop") is used and set as
    current event loop with [`asyncio.set_event_loop()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.set_event_loop "asyncio.set_event_loop") if *loop_factory* is `None`.

    Basically, [`asyncio.run()`](asyncio-runner.md#asyncio.run "asyncio.run") example can be rewritten with the runner usage:

    ```python3
    async def main():
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print('hello')

    with asyncio.Runner() as runner:
        runner.run(main())
    ```

    Added in version 3.11.

    run(*coro*, *\**, *context=None*)
    :   Run a [coroutine](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-coroutine) *coro* in the embedded loop.

        Return the coroutine’s result or raise its exception.

        An optional keyword-only *context* argument allows specifying a
        custom [`contextvars.Context`](contextvars.md#contextvars.Context "contextvars.Context") for the *coro* to run in.
        The runner’s default context is used if `None`.

        This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is
        running in the same thread.

    close()
    :   Close the runner.

        Finalize asynchronous generators, shutdown default executor, close the event loop
        and release embedded [`contextvars.Context`](contextvars.md#contextvars.Context "contextvars.Context").

    get_loop()
    :   Return the event loop associated with the runner instance.

## Handling Keyboard Interruption

Added in version 3.11.

When [`signal.SIGINT`](signal.md#signal.SIGINT "signal.SIGINT") is raised by `Ctrl`-`C`, [`KeyboardInterrupt`](exceptions.md#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt")
exception is raised in the main thread by default. However this doesn’t work with
[`asyncio`](asyncio.md#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O.") because it can interrupt asyncio internals and can hang the program from
exiting.

To mitigate this issue, [`asyncio`](asyncio.md#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O.") handles [`signal.SIGINT`](signal.md#signal.SIGINT "signal.SIGINT") as follows:

1. [`asyncio.Runner.run()`](asyncio-runner.md#asyncio.Runner.run "asyncio.Runner.run") installs a custom [`signal.SIGINT`](signal.md#signal.SIGINT "signal.SIGINT") handler before
   any user code is executed and removes it when exiting from the function.
2. The [`Runner`](asyncio-runner.md#asyncio.Runner "asyncio.Runner") creates the main task for the passed coroutine for its
   execution.
3. When [`signal.SIGINT`](signal.md#signal.SIGINT "signal.SIGINT") is raised by `Ctrl`-`C`, the custom signal handler
   cancels the main task by calling [`asyncio.Task.cancel()`](asyncio-task.md#asyncio.Task.cancel "asyncio.Task.cancel") which raises
   [`asyncio.CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.md#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") inside the main task. This causes the Python stack
   to unwind, `try/except` and `try/finally` blocks can be used for resource
   cleanup. After the main task is cancelled, [`asyncio.Runner.run()`](asyncio-runner.md#asyncio.Runner.run "asyncio.Runner.run") raises
   [`KeyboardInterrupt`](exceptions.md#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt").
4. A user could write a tight loop which cannot be interrupted by
   [`asyncio.Task.cancel()`](asyncio-task.md#asyncio.Task.cancel "asyncio.Task.cancel"), in which case the second following `Ctrl`-`C`
   immediately raises the [`KeyboardInterrupt`](exceptions.md#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt") without cancelling the main task.
