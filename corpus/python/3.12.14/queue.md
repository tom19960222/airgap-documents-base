# `queue` — A synchronized queue class

**Source code:** [Lib/queue.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/queue.py)

---

The [`queue`](queue.md#module-queue "queue: A synchronized queue class.") module implements multi-producer, multi-consumer queues.
It is especially useful in threaded programming when information must be
exchanged safely between multiple threads. The [`Queue`](queue.md#queue.Queue "queue.Queue") class in this
module implements all the required locking semantics.

The module implements three types of queue, which differ only in the order in
which the entries are retrieved. In a FIFO
queue, the first tasks added are the first retrieved. In a
LIFO queue, the most recently added entry is
the first retrieved (operating like a stack). With a priority queue,
the entries are kept sorted (using the [`heapq`](heapq.md#module-heapq "heapq: Heap queue algorithm (a.k.a. priority queue).") module) and the
lowest valued entry is retrieved first.

Internally, those three types of queues use locks to temporarily block
competing threads; however, they are not designed to handle reentrancy
within a thread.

In addition, the module implements a “simple”
FIFO queue type, [`SimpleQueue`](queue.md#queue.SimpleQueue "queue.SimpleQueue"), whose
specific implementation provides additional guarantees
in exchange for the smaller functionality.

The [`queue`](queue.md#module-queue "queue: A synchronized queue class.") module defines the following classes and exceptions:

*class* queue.Queue(*maxsize=0*)
:   Constructor for a FIFO queue. *maxsize* is
    an integer that sets the upperbound
    limit on the number of items that can be placed in the queue. Insertion will
    block once this size has been reached, until queue items are consumed. If
    *maxsize* is less than or equal to zero, the queue size is infinite.

*class* queue.LifoQueue(*maxsize=0*)
:   Constructor for a LIFO queue. *maxsize* is
    an integer that sets the upperbound
    limit on the number of items that can be placed in the queue. Insertion will
    block once this size has been reached, until queue items are consumed. If
    *maxsize* is less than or equal to zero, the queue size is infinite.

*class* queue.PriorityQueue(*maxsize=0*)
:   Constructor for a priority queue. *maxsize* is an integer that sets the upperbound
    limit on the number of items that can be placed in the queue. Insertion will
    block once this size has been reached, until queue items are consumed. If
    *maxsize* is less than or equal to zero, the queue size is infinite.

    The lowest valued entries are retrieved first (the lowest valued entry is the
    one that would be returned by `min(entries)`). A typical pattern for
    entries is a tuple in the form: `(priority_number, data)`.

    If the *data* elements are not comparable, the data can be wrapped in a class
    that ignores the data item and only compares the priority number:

    ```python3
    from dataclasses import dataclass, field
    from typing import Any

    @dataclass(order=True)
    class PrioritizedItem:
        priority: int
        item: Any=field(compare=False)
    ```

*class* queue.SimpleQueue
:   Constructor for an unbounded FIFO queue.
    Simple queues lack advanced functionality such as task tracking.

    Added in version 3.7.

*exception* queue.Empty
:   Exception raised when non-blocking [`get()`](queue.md#queue.Queue.get "queue.Queue.get") (or
    [`get_nowait()`](queue.md#queue.Queue.get_nowait "queue.Queue.get_nowait")) is called
    on a [`Queue`](queue.md#queue.Queue "queue.Queue") object which is empty.

*exception* queue.Full
:   Exception raised when non-blocking [`put()`](queue.md#queue.Queue.put "queue.Queue.put") (or
    [`put_nowait()`](queue.md#queue.Queue.put_nowait "queue.Queue.put_nowait")) is called
    on a [`Queue`](queue.md#queue.Queue "queue.Queue") object which is full.

## Queue Objects

Queue objects ([`Queue`](queue.md#queue.Queue "queue.Queue"), [`LifoQueue`](queue.md#queue.LifoQueue "queue.LifoQueue"), or [`PriorityQueue`](queue.md#queue.PriorityQueue "queue.PriorityQueue"))
provide the public methods described below.

Queue.qsize()
:   Return the approximate size of the queue. Note, qsize() > 0 doesn’t
    guarantee that a subsequent get() will not block, nor will qsize() < maxsize
    guarantee that put() will not block.

Queue.empty()
:   Return `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise. If empty()
    returns `True` it doesn’t guarantee that a subsequent call to put()
    will not block. Similarly, if empty() returns `False` it doesn’t
    guarantee that a subsequent call to get() will not block.

Queue.full()
:   Return `True` if the queue is full, `False` otherwise. If full()
    returns `True` it doesn’t guarantee that a subsequent call to get()
    will not block. Similarly, if full() returns `False` it doesn’t
    guarantee that a subsequent call to put() will not block.

Queue.put(*item*, *block=True*, *timeout=None*)
:   Put *item* into the queue. If optional args *block* is true and *timeout* is
    `None` (the default), block if necessary until a free slot is available. If
    *timeout* is a positive number, it blocks at most *timeout* seconds and raises
    the [`Full`](queue.md#queue.Full "queue.Full") exception if no free slot was available within that time.
    Otherwise (*block* is false), put an item on the queue if a free slot is
    immediately available, else raise the [`Full`](queue.md#queue.Full "queue.Full") exception (*timeout* is
    ignored in that case).

Queue.put_nowait(*item*)
:   Equivalent to `put(item, block=False)`.

Queue.get(*block=True*, *timeout=None*)
:   Remove and return an item from the queue. If optional args *block* is true and
    *timeout* is `None` (the default), block if necessary until an item is available.
    If *timeout* is a positive number, it blocks at most *timeout* seconds and
    raises the [`Empty`](queue.md#queue.Empty "queue.Empty") exception if no item was available within that time.
    Otherwise (*block* is false), return an item if one is immediately available,
    else raise the [`Empty`](queue.md#queue.Empty "queue.Empty") exception (*timeout* is ignored in that case).

    Prior to 3.0 on POSIX systems, and for all versions on Windows, if
    *block* is true and *timeout* is `None`, this operation goes into
    an uninterruptible wait on an underlying lock. This means that no exceptions
    can occur, and in particular a SIGINT will not trigger a [`KeyboardInterrupt`](exceptions.md#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt").

Queue.get_nowait()
:   Equivalent to `get(False)`.

Two methods are offered to support tracking whether enqueued tasks have been
fully processed by daemon consumer threads.

Queue.task_done()
:   Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete. Used by queue consumer
    threads. For each [`get()`](queue.md#queue.Queue.get "queue.Queue.get") used to fetch a task, a subsequent call to
    [`task_done()`](queue.md#queue.Queue.task_done "queue.Queue.task_done") tells the queue that the processing on the task is complete.

    If a [`join()`](queue.md#queue.Queue.join "queue.Queue.join") is currently blocking, it will resume when all items have been
    processed (meaning that a [`task_done()`](queue.md#queue.Queue.task_done "queue.Queue.task_done") call was received for every item
    that had been [`put()`](queue.md#queue.Queue.put "queue.Queue.put") into the queue).

    Raises a [`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError "ValueError") if called more times than there were items placed in
    the queue.

Queue.join()
:   Blocks until all items in the queue have been gotten and processed.

    The count of unfinished tasks goes up whenever an item is added to the queue.
    The count goes down whenever a consumer thread calls [`task_done()`](queue.md#queue.Queue.task_done "queue.Queue.task_done") to
    indicate that the item was retrieved and all work on it is complete. When the
    count of unfinished tasks drops to zero, [`join()`](queue.md#queue.Queue.join "queue.Queue.join") unblocks.

Example of how to wait for enqueued tasks to be completed:

```python3
import threading
import queue

q = queue.Queue()

def worker():
    while True:
        item = q.get()
        print(f'Working on {item}')
        print(f'Finished {item}')
        q.task_done()

# Turn-on the worker thread.
threading.Thread(target=worker, daemon=True).start()

# Send thirty task requests to the worker.
for item in range(30):
    q.put(item)

# Block until all tasks are done.
q.join()
print('All work completed')
```

## SimpleQueue Objects

[`SimpleQueue`](queue.md#queue.SimpleQueue "queue.SimpleQueue") objects provide the public methods described below.

SimpleQueue.qsize()
:   Return the approximate size of the queue. Note, qsize() > 0 doesn’t
    guarantee that a subsequent get() will not block.

SimpleQueue.empty()
:   Return `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise. If empty()
    returns `False` it doesn’t guarantee that a subsequent call to get()
    will not block.

SimpleQueue.put(*item*, *block=True*, *timeout=None*)
:   Put *item* into the queue. The method never blocks and always succeeds
    (except for potential low-level errors such as failure to allocate memory).
    The optional args *block* and *timeout* are ignored and only provided
    for compatibility with [`Queue.put()`](queue.md#queue.Queue.put "queue.Queue.put").

    **CPython implementation detail:** This method has a C implementation which is reentrant. That is, a
    `put()` or `get()` call can be interrupted by another `put()`
    call in the same thread without deadlocking or corrupting internal
    state inside the queue. This makes it appropriate for use in
    destructors such as `__del__` methods or [`weakref`](weakref.md#module-weakref "weakref: Support for weak references and weak dictionaries.") callbacks.

SimpleQueue.put_nowait(*item*)
:   Equivalent to `put(item, block=False)`, provided for compatibility with
    [`Queue.put_nowait()`](queue.md#queue.Queue.put_nowait "queue.Queue.put_nowait").

SimpleQueue.get(*block=True*, *timeout=None*)
:   Remove and return an item from the queue. If optional args *block* is true and
    *timeout* is `None` (the default), block if necessary until an item is available.
    If *timeout* is a positive number, it blocks at most *timeout* seconds and
    raises the [`Empty`](queue.md#queue.Empty "queue.Empty") exception if no item was available within that time.
    Otherwise (*block* is false), return an item if one is immediately available,
    else raise the [`Empty`](queue.md#queue.Empty "queue.Empty") exception (*timeout* is ignored in that case).

SimpleQueue.get_nowait()
:   Equivalent to `get(False)`.
