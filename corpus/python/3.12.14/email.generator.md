# `email.generator`: Generating MIME documents

**Source code:** [Lib/email/generator.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/email/generator.py)

---

One of the most common tasks is to generate the flat (serialized) version of
the email message represented by a message object structure. You will need to
do this if you want to send your message via [`smtplib.SMTP.sendmail()`](smtplib.md#smtplib.SMTP.sendmail "smtplib.SMTP.sendmail") or
the [`nntplib`](nntplib.md#module-nntplib "nntplib: NNTP protocol client (requires sockets). (deprecated)") module, or print the message on the console. Taking a
message object structure and producing a serialized representation is the job
of the generator classes.

As with the [`email.parser`](email.parser.md#module-email.parser "email.parser: Parse flat text email messages to produce a message object structure.") module, you aren’t limited to the functionality
of the bundled generator; you could write one from scratch yourself. However
the bundled generator knows how to generate most email in a standards-compliant
way, should handle MIME and non-MIME email messages just fine, and is designed
so that the bytes-oriented parsing and generation operations are inverses,
assuming the same non-transforming [`policy`](email.policy.md#module-email.policy "email.policy: Controlling the parsing and generating of messages") is used for both. That
is, parsing the serialized byte stream via the
[`BytesParser`](email.parser.md#email.parser.BytesParser "email.parser.BytesParser") class and then regenerating the serialized
byte stream using [`BytesGenerator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.BytesGenerator "email.generator.BytesGenerator") should produce output identical to
the input [[1]](email.generator.md#id3). (On the other hand, using the generator on an
[`EmailMessage`](email.message.md#email.message.EmailMessage "email.message.EmailMessage") constructed by program may result in
changes to the [`EmailMessage`](email.message.md#email.message.EmailMessage "email.message.EmailMessage") object as defaults are
filled in.)

The [`Generator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator "email.generator.Generator") class can be used to flatten a message into a text (as
opposed to binary) serialized representation, but since Unicode cannot
represent binary data directly, the message is of necessity transformed into
something that contains only ASCII characters, using the standard email RFC
Content Transfer Encoding techniques for encoding email messages for transport
over channels that are not “8 bit clean”.

To accommodate reproducible processing of SMIME-signed messages
[`Generator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator "email.generator.Generator") disables header folding for message parts of type
`multipart/signed` and all subparts.

`class email.generator.BytesGenerator(outfp, mangle_from_=None, maxheaderlen=None, *, policy=None)`
:   Return a [`BytesGenerator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.BytesGenerator "email.generator.BytesGenerator") object that will write any message provided
    to the [`flatten()`](email.generator.md#email.generator.BytesGenerator.flatten "email.generator.BytesGenerator.flatten") method, or any surrogateescape encoded text provided
    to the [`write()`](email.generator.md#email.generator.BytesGenerator.write "email.generator.BytesGenerator.write") method, to the [file-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-file-like-object) *outfp*.
    *outfp* must support a `write` method that accepts binary data.

    If optional *mangle_from_* is `True`, put a `>` character in front of
    any line in the body that starts with the exact string `"From "`, that is
    `From` followed by a space at the beginning of a line. *mangle_from_*
    defaults to the value of the [`mangle_from_`](email.policy.md#email.policy.Policy.mangle_from_ "email.policy.Policy.mangle_from_")
    setting of the *policy* (which is `True` for the
    [`compat32`](email.policy.md#email.policy.compat32 "email.policy.compat32") policy and `False` for all others).
    *mangle_from_* is intended for use when messages are stored in Unix mbox
    format (see [`mailbox`](mailbox.md#module-mailbox "mailbox: Manipulate mailboxes in various formats") and [WHY THE CONTENT-LENGTH FORMAT IS BAD](https://www.jwz.org/doc/content-length.html)).

    If *maxheaderlen* is not `None`, refold any header lines that are longer
    than *maxheaderlen*, or if `0`, do not rewrap any headers. If
    *manheaderlen* is `None` (the default), wrap headers and other message
    lines according to the *policy* settings.

    If *policy* is specified, use that policy to control message generation. If
    *policy* is `None` (the default), use the policy associated with the
    [`Message`](email.compat32-message.md#email.message.Message "email.message.Message") or [`EmailMessage`](email.message.md#email.message.EmailMessage "email.message.EmailMessage")
    object passed to `flatten` to control the message generation. See
    [`email.policy`](email.policy.md#module-email.policy "email.policy: Controlling the parsing and generating of messages") for details on what *policy* controls.

    Added in version 3.2.

    Changed in version 3.3: Added the *policy* keyword.

    Changed in version 3.6: The default behavior of the *mangle_from_*
    and *maxheaderlen* parameters is to follow the policy.

    `flatten(msg, unixfrom=False, linesep=None)`
    :   Print the textual representation of the message object structure rooted
        at *msg* to the output file specified when the [`BytesGenerator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.BytesGenerator "email.generator.BytesGenerator")
        instance was created.

        If the [`policy`](email.policy.md#module-email.policy "email.policy: Controlling the parsing and generating of messages") option [`cte_type`](email.policy.md#email.policy.Policy.cte_type "email.policy.Policy.cte_type")
        is `8bit` (the default), copy any headers in the original parsed
        message that have not been modified to the output with any bytes with the
        high bit set reproduced as in the original, and preserve the non-ASCII
        *Content-Transfer-Encoding* of any body parts that have them.
        If `cte_type` is `7bit`, convert the bytes with the high bit set as
        needed using an ASCII-compatible *Content-Transfer-Encoding*.
        That is, transform parts with non-ASCII
        *Content-Transfer-Encoding*
        (*Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit*) to an ASCII compatible
        *Content-Transfer-Encoding*, and encode RFC-invalid non-ASCII
        bytes in headers using the MIME `unknown-8bit` character set, thus
        rendering them RFC-compliant.

        If *unixfrom* is `True`, print the envelope header delimiter used by
        the Unix mailbox format (see [`mailbox`](mailbox.md#module-mailbox "mailbox: Manipulate mailboxes in various formats")) before the first of the
        [**RFC 5322**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322.html) headers of the root message object. If the root object has
        no envelope header, craft a standard one. The default is `False`.
        Note that for subparts, no envelope header is ever printed.

        If *linesep* is not `None`, use it as the separator character between
        all the lines of the flattened message. If *linesep* is `None` (the
        default), use the value specified in the *policy*.

    `clone(fp)`
    :   Return an independent clone of this [`BytesGenerator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.BytesGenerator "email.generator.BytesGenerator") instance with
        the exact same option settings, and *fp* as the new *outfp*.

    `write(s)`
    :   Encode *s* using the `ASCII` codec and the `surrogateescape` error
        handler, and pass it to the *write* method of the *outfp* passed to the
        [`BytesGenerator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.BytesGenerator "email.generator.BytesGenerator")’s constructor.

As a convenience, [`EmailMessage`](email.message.md#email.message.EmailMessage "email.message.EmailMessage") provides the methods
[`as_bytes()`](email.message.md#email.message.EmailMessage.as_bytes "email.message.EmailMessage.as_bytes") and `bytes(aMessage)` (a.k.a.
[`__bytes__()`](email.message.md#email.message.EmailMessage.__bytes__ "email.message.EmailMessage.__bytes__")), which simplify the generation of
a serialized binary representation of a message object. For more detail, see
[`email.message`](email.message.md#module-email.message "email.message: The base class representing email messages.").

Because strings cannot represent binary data, the [`Generator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator "email.generator.Generator") class must
convert any binary data in any message it flattens to an ASCII compatible
format, by converting them to an ASCII compatible
*Content-Transfer_Encoding*. Using the terminology of the email
RFCs, you can think of this as [`Generator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator "email.generator.Generator") serializing to an I/O stream
that is not “8 bit clean”. In other words, most applications will want
to be using [`BytesGenerator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.BytesGenerator "email.generator.BytesGenerator"), and not [`Generator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator "email.generator.Generator").

`class email.generator.Generator(outfp, mangle_from_=None, maxheaderlen=None, *, policy=None)`
:   Return a [`Generator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator "email.generator.Generator") object that will write any message provided
    to the [`flatten()`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator.flatten "email.generator.Generator.flatten") method, or any text provided to the [`write()`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator.write "email.generator.Generator.write")
    method, to the [file-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-file-like-object) *outfp*. *outfp* must support a
    `write` method that accepts string data.

    If optional *mangle_from_* is `True`, put a `>` character in front of
    any line in the body that starts with the exact string `"From "`, that is
    `From` followed by a space at the beginning of a line. *mangle_from_*
    defaults to the value of the [`mangle_from_`](email.policy.md#email.policy.Policy.mangle_from_ "email.policy.Policy.mangle_from_")
    setting of the *policy* (which is `True` for the
    [`compat32`](email.policy.md#email.policy.compat32 "email.policy.compat32") policy and `False` for all others).
    *mangle_from_* is intended for use when messages are stored in Unix mbox
    format (see [`mailbox`](mailbox.md#module-mailbox "mailbox: Manipulate mailboxes in various formats") and [WHY THE CONTENT-LENGTH FORMAT IS BAD](https://www.jwz.org/doc/content-length.html)).

    If *maxheaderlen* is not `None`, refold any header lines that are longer
    than *maxheaderlen*, or if `0`, do not rewrap any headers. If
    *manheaderlen* is `None` (the default), wrap headers and other message
    lines according to the *policy* settings.

    If *policy* is specified, use that policy to control message generation. If
    *policy* is `None` (the default), use the policy associated with the
    [`Message`](email.compat32-message.md#email.message.Message "email.message.Message") or [`EmailMessage`](email.message.md#email.message.EmailMessage "email.message.EmailMessage")
    object passed to `flatten` to control the message generation. See
    [`email.policy`](email.policy.md#module-email.policy "email.policy: Controlling the parsing and generating of messages") for details on what *policy* controls.

    Changed in version 3.3: Added the *policy* keyword.

    Changed in version 3.6: The default behavior of the *mangle_from_*
    and *maxheaderlen* parameters is to follow the policy.

    `flatten(msg, unixfrom=False, linesep=None)`
    :   Print the textual representation of the message object structure rooted
        at *msg* to the output file specified when the [`Generator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator "email.generator.Generator")
        instance was created.

        If the [`policy`](email.policy.md#module-email.policy "email.policy: Controlling the parsing and generating of messages") option [`cte_type`](email.policy.md#email.policy.Policy.cte_type "email.policy.Policy.cte_type")
        is `8bit`, generate the message as if the option were set to `7bit`.
        (This is required because strings cannot represent non-ASCII bytes.)
        Convert any bytes with the high bit set as needed using an
        ASCII-compatible *Content-Transfer-Encoding*. That is,
        transform parts with non-ASCII *Content-Transfer-Encoding*
        (*Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit*) to an ASCII compatible
        *Content-Transfer-Encoding*, and encode RFC-invalid non-ASCII
        bytes in headers using the MIME `unknown-8bit` character set, thus
        rendering them RFC-compliant.

        If *unixfrom* is `True`, print the envelope header delimiter used by
        the Unix mailbox format (see [`mailbox`](mailbox.md#module-mailbox "mailbox: Manipulate mailboxes in various formats")) before the first of the
        [**RFC 5322**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322.html) headers of the root message object. If the root object has
        no envelope header, craft a standard one. The default is `False`.
        Note that for subparts, no envelope header is ever printed.

        If *linesep* is not `None`, use it as the separator character between
        all the lines of the flattened message. If *linesep* is `None` (the
        default), use the value specified in the *policy*.

        Changed in version 3.2: Added support for re-encoding `8bit` message bodies, and the
        *linesep* argument.

    `clone(fp)`
    :   Return an independent clone of this [`Generator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator "email.generator.Generator") instance with the
        exact same options, and *fp* as the new *outfp*.

    `write(s)`
    :   Write *s* to the *write* method of the *outfp* passed to the
        [`Generator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator "email.generator.Generator")’s constructor. This provides just enough file-like
        API for [`Generator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator "email.generator.Generator") instances to be used in the [`print()`](functions.md#print "print")
        function.

As a convenience, [`EmailMessage`](email.message.md#email.message.EmailMessage "email.message.EmailMessage") provides the methods
[`as_string()`](email.message.md#email.message.EmailMessage.as_string "email.message.EmailMessage.as_string") and `str(aMessage)` (a.k.a.
[`__str__()`](email.message.md#email.message.EmailMessage.__str__ "email.message.EmailMessage.__str__")), which simplify the generation of
a formatted string representation of a message object. For more detail, see
[`email.message`](email.message.md#module-email.message "email.message: The base class representing email messages.").

The [`email.generator`](email.generator.md#module-email.generator "email.generator: Generate flat text email messages from a message structure.") module also provides a derived class,
[`DecodedGenerator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.DecodedGenerator "email.generator.DecodedGenerator"), which is like the [`Generator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator "email.generator.Generator") base class,
except that non-*text* parts are not serialized, but are instead
represented in the output stream by a string derived from a template filled
in with information about the part.

`class email.generator.DecodedGenerator(outfp, mangle_from_=None, maxheaderlen=None, fmt=None, *, policy=None)`
:   Act like [`Generator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator "email.generator.Generator"), except that for any subpart of the message
    passed to [`Generator.flatten()`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator.flatten "email.generator.Generator.flatten"), if the subpart is of main type
    *text*, print the decoded payload of the subpart, and if the main
    type is not *text*, instead of printing it fill in the string
    *fmt* using information from the part and print the resulting
    filled-in string.

    To fill in *fmt*, execute `fmt % part_info`, where `part_info`
    is a dictionary composed of the following keys and values:

    - `type` – Full MIME type of the non-*text* part
    - `maintype` – Main MIME type of the non-*text* part
    - `subtype` – Sub-MIME type of the non-*text* part
    - `filename` – Filename of the non-*text* part
    - `description` – Description associated with the non-*text* part
    - `encoding` – Content transfer encoding of the non-*text* part

    If *fmt* is `None`, use the following default *fmt*:

    > “[Non-text (%(type)s) part of message omitted, filename %(filename)s]”

    Optional *_mangle_from_* and *maxheaderlen* are as with the
    [`Generator`](email.generator.md#email.generator.Generator "email.generator.Generator") base class.

Footnotes

[[1](email.generator.md#id1)]

This statement assumes that you use the appropriate setting for
`unixfrom`, and that there are no [`email.policy`](email.policy.md#module-email.policy "email.policy: Controlling the parsing and generating of messages") settings calling for
automatic adjustments (for example,
[`refold_source`](email.policy.md#email.policy.EmailPolicy.refold_source "email.policy.EmailPolicy.refold_source") must be `none`, which is
*not* the default). It is also not 100% true, since if the message
does not conform to the RFC standards occasionally information about the
exact original text is lost during parsing error recovery. It is a goal
to fix these latter edge cases when possible.
