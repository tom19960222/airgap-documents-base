# `atexit` — Exit handlers

---

The [`atexit`](atexit.md#module-atexit "atexit: Register and execute cleanup functions.") module defines functions to register and unregister cleanup
functions. Functions thus registered are automatically executed upon normal
interpreter termination. [`atexit`](atexit.md#module-atexit "atexit: Register and execute cleanup functions.") runs these functions in the *reverse*
order in which they were registered; if you register `A`, `B`, and `C`,
at interpreter termination time they will be run in the order `C`, `B`,
`A`.

**Note:** The functions registered via this module are not called when the
program is killed by a signal not handled by Python, when a Python fatal
internal error is detected, or when [`os._exit()`](os.md#os._exit "os._exit") is called.

**Note:** The effect of registering or unregistering functions from within
a cleanup function is undefined.

Changed in version 3.7: When used with C-API subinterpreters, registered functions
are local to the interpreter they were registered in.

atexit.register(*func*, *\*args*, *\*\*kwargs*)
:   Register *func* as a function to be executed at termination. Any optional
    arguments that are to be passed to *func* must be passed as arguments to
    [`register()`](atexit.md#atexit.register "atexit.register"). It is possible to register the same function and arguments
    more than once.

    At normal program termination (for instance, if [`sys.exit()`](sys.md#sys.exit "sys.exit") is called or
    the main module’s execution completes), all functions registered are called in
    last in, first out order. The assumption is that lower level modules will
    normally be imported before higher level modules and thus must be cleaned up
    later.

    If an exception is raised during execution of the exit handlers, a traceback is
    printed (unless [`SystemExit`](exceptions.md#SystemExit "SystemExit") is raised) and the exception information is
    saved. After all exit handlers have had a chance to run, the last exception to
    be raised is re-raised.

    This function returns *func*, which makes it possible to use it as a
    decorator.

    > **Warning:**

    > Starting new threads or calling [`os.fork()`](os.md#os.fork "os.fork") from a registered

    > runtime thread freeing thread states while internal [`threading`](threading.md#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.")
    > routines or the new process try to use that state. This can lead to
    > crashes rather than clean shutdown.

    Changed in version 3.12: Attempts to start a new thread or [`os.fork()`](os.md#os.fork "os.fork") a new process
    in a registered function now leads to [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError "RuntimeError").

atexit.unregister(*func*)
:   Remove *func* from the list of functions to be run at interpreter shutdown.
    [`unregister()`](atexit.md#atexit.unregister "atexit.unregister") silently does nothing if *func* was not previously
    registered. If *func* has been registered more than once, every occurrence
    of that function in the [`atexit`](atexit.md#module-atexit "atexit: Register and execute cleanup functions.") call stack will be removed. Equality
    comparisons (`==`) are used internally during unregistration, so function
    references do not need to have matching identities.

## `atexit` Example

The following simple example demonstrates how a module can initialize a counter
from a file when it is imported and save the counter’s updated value
automatically when the program terminates without relying on the application
making an explicit call into this module at termination.

```python3
try:
    with open('counterfile') as infile:
        _count = int(infile.read())
except FileNotFoundError:
    _count = 0

def incrcounter(n):
    global _count
    _count = _count + n

def savecounter():
    with open('counterfile', 'w') as outfile:
        outfile.write('%d' % _count)

import atexit

atexit.register(savecounter)
```

Positional and keyword arguments may also be passed to [`register()`](atexit.md#atexit.register "atexit.register") to be
passed along to the registered function when it is called:

```python3
def goodbye(name, adjective):
    print('Goodbye %s, it was %s to meet you.' % (name, adjective))

import atexit

atexit.register(goodbye, 'Donny', 'nice')
# or:
atexit.register(goodbye, adjective='nice', name='Donny')
```

Usage as a [decorator](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-decorator):

```python3
import atexit

@atexit.register
def goodbye():
    print('You are now leaving the Python sector.')
```

This only works with functions that can be called without arguments.
