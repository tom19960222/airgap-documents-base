# `contextlib` — Utilities for `with`-statement contexts

**Source code:** [Lib/contextlib.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/contextlib.py)

---

This module provides utilities for common tasks involving the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with)
statement. For more information see also [Context Manager Types](stdtypes.md#typecontextmanager) and
[With Statement Context Managers](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers).

## Utilities

Functions and classes provided:

`class contextlib.AbstractContextManager`
:   An [abstract base class](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-abstract-base-class) for classes that implement
    [`object.__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") and [`object.__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__"). A default
    implementation for [`object.__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") is provided which returns
    `self` while [`object.__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") is an abstract method which by default
    returns `None`. See also the definition of [Context Manager Types](stdtypes.md#typecontextmanager).

    Added in version 3.6.

`class contextlib.AbstractAsyncContextManager`
:   An [abstract base class](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-abstract-base-class) for classes that implement
    [`object.__aenter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aenter__ "object.__aenter__") and [`object.__aexit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aexit__ "object.__aexit__"). A default
    implementation for [`object.__aenter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aenter__ "object.__aenter__") is provided which returns
    `self` while [`object.__aexit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aexit__ "object.__aexit__") is an abstract method which by default
    returns `None`. See also the definition of
    [Asynchronous Context Managers](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#async-context-managers).

    Added in version 3.7.

`@contextlib.contextmanager`
:   This function is a [decorator](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-decorator) that can be used to define a factory
    function for [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement context managers, without needing to
    create a class or separate [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") and [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") methods.

    While many objects natively support use in with statements, sometimes a
    resource needs to be managed that isn’t a context manager in its own right,
    and doesn’t implement a `close()` method for use with `contextlib.closing`

    An abstract example would be the following to ensure correct resource
    management:

    ```python3
    from contextlib import contextmanager

    @contextmanager
    def managed_resource(*args, **kwds):
        # Code to acquire resource, e.g.:
        resource = acquire_resource(*args, **kwds)
        try:
            yield resource
        finally:
            # Code to release resource, e.g.:
            release_resource(resource)
    ```

    The function can then be used like this:

    ```python3
    >>> with managed_resource(timeout=3600) as resource:
    ...     # Resource is released at the end of this block,
    ...     # even if code in the block raises an exception
    ```

    The function being decorated must return a [generator](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-generator)-iterator when
    called. This iterator must yield exactly one value, which will be bound to
    the targets in the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement’s `as` clause, if any.

    At the point where the generator yields, the block nested in the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with)
    statement is executed. The generator is then resumed after the block is exited.
    If an unhandled exception occurs in the block, it is reraised inside the
    generator at the point where the yield occurred. Thus, you can use a
    [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#try)…[`except`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#except)…[`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) statement to trap
    the error (if any), or ensure that some cleanup takes place. If an exception is
    trapped merely in order to log it or to perform some action (rather than to
    suppress it entirely), the generator must reraise that exception. Otherwise the
    generator context manager will indicate to the `with` statement that
    the exception has been handled, and execution will resume with the statement
    immediately following the `with` statement.

    [`contextmanager()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.contextmanager "contextlib.contextmanager") uses [`ContextDecorator`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ContextDecorator "contextlib.ContextDecorator") so the context managers
    it creates can be used as decorators as well as in [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statements.
    When used as a decorator, a new generator instance is implicitly created on
    each function call (this allows the otherwise “one-shot” context managers
    created by [`contextmanager()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.contextmanager "contextlib.contextmanager") to meet the requirement that context
    managers support multiple invocations in order to be used as decorators).

    Changed in version 3.2: Use of [`ContextDecorator`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ContextDecorator "contextlib.ContextDecorator").

`@contextlib.asynccontextmanager`
:   Similar to [`contextmanager()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.contextmanager "contextlib.contextmanager"), but creates an
    [asynchronous context manager](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#async-context-managers).

    This function is a [decorator](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-decorator) that can be used to define a factory
    function for [`async with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-with) statement asynchronous context managers,
    without needing to create a class or separate [`__aenter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aenter__ "object.__aenter__") and
    [`__aexit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__aexit__ "object.__aexit__") methods. It must be applied to an [asynchronous
    generator](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-generator) function.

    A simple example:

    ```python3
    from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

    @asynccontextmanager
    async def get_connection():
        conn = await acquire_db_connection()
        try:
            yield conn
        finally:
            await release_db_connection(conn)

    async def get_all_users():
        async with get_connection() as conn:
            return conn.query('SELECT ...')
    ```

    Added in version 3.7.

    Context managers defined with [`asynccontextmanager()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.asynccontextmanager "contextlib.asynccontextmanager") can be used
    either as decorators or with [`async with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-with) statements:

    ```python3
    import time
    from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

    @asynccontextmanager
    async def timeit():
        now = time.monotonic()
        try:
            yield
        finally:
            print(f'it took {time.monotonic() - now}s to run')

    @timeit()
    async def main():
        # ... async code ...
    ```

    When used as a decorator, a new generator instance is implicitly created on
    each function call. This allows the otherwise “one-shot” context managers
    created by [`asynccontextmanager()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.asynccontextmanager "contextlib.asynccontextmanager") to meet the requirement that context
    managers support multiple invocations in order to be used as decorators.

    Changed in version 3.10: Async context managers created with [`asynccontextmanager()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.asynccontextmanager "contextlib.asynccontextmanager") can
    be used as decorators.

`contextlib.closing(thing)`
:   Return a context manager that closes *thing* upon completion of the block. This
    is basically equivalent to:

    ```python3
    from contextlib import contextmanager

    @contextmanager
    def closing(thing):
        try:
            yield thing
        finally:
            thing.close()
    ```

    And lets you write code like this:

    ```python3
    from contextlib import closing
    from urllib.request import urlopen

    with closing(urlopen('https://www.python.org')) as page:
        for line in page:
            print(line)
    ```

    without needing to explicitly close `page`. Even if an error occurs,
    `page.close()` will be called when the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) block is exited.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > Most types managing resources support the [context manager](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-context-manager) protocol,
    > which closes *thing* on leaving the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement.
    > As such, `closing()` is most useful for third party types that don’t
    > support context managers.
    > This example is purely for illustration purposes,
    > as [`urlopen()`](urllib.request.md#urllib.request.urlopen "urllib.request.urlopen") would normally be used in a context manager.

`contextlib.aclosing(thing)`
:   Return an async context manager that calls the `aclose()` method of *thing*
    upon completion of the block. This is basically equivalent to:

    ```python3
    from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

    @asynccontextmanager
    async def aclosing(thing):
        try:
            yield thing
        finally:
            await thing.aclose()
    ```

    Significantly, `aclosing()` supports deterministic cleanup of async
    generators when they happen to exit early by [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/simple_stmts.html#break) or an
    exception. For example:

    ```python3
    from contextlib import aclosing

    async with aclosing(my_generator()) as values:
        async for value in values:
            if value == 42:
                break
    ```

    This pattern ensures that the generator’s async exit code is executed in
    the same context as its iterations (so that exceptions and context
    variables work as expected, and the exit code isn’t run after the
    lifetime of some task it depends on).

    Added in version 3.10.

`contextlib.nullcontext(enter_result=None)`
:   Return a context manager that returns *enter_result* from `__enter__`, but
    otherwise does nothing. It is intended to be used as a stand-in for an
    optional context manager, for example:

    ```python3
    def myfunction(arg, ignore_exceptions=False):
        if ignore_exceptions:
            # Use suppress to ignore all exceptions.
            cm = contextlib.suppress(Exception)
        else:
            # Do not ignore any exceptions, cm has no effect.
            cm = contextlib.nullcontext()
        with cm:
            # Do something
    ```

    An example using *enter_result*:

    ```python3
    def process_file(file_or_path):
        if isinstance(file_or_path, str):
            # If string, open file
            cm = open(file_or_path)
        else:
            # Caller is responsible for closing file
            cm = nullcontext(file_or_path)

        with cm as file:
            # Perform processing on the file
    ```

    It can also be used as a stand-in for
    [asynchronous context managers](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#async-context-managers):

    ```python3
    async def send_http(session=None):
        if not session:
            # If no http session, create it with aiohttp
            cm = aiohttp.ClientSession()
        else:
            # Caller is responsible for closing the session
            cm = nullcontext(session)

        async with cm as session:
            # Send http requests with session
    ```

    Added in version 3.7.

    Changed in version 3.10: [asynchronous context manager](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-context-manager) support was added.

`contextlib.suppress(*exceptions)`
:   Return a context manager that suppresses any of the specified exceptions
    if they occur in the body of a `with` statement and then
    resumes execution with the first statement following the end of the
    `with` statement.

    As with any other mechanism that completely suppresses exceptions, this
    context manager should be used only to cover very specific errors where
    silently continuing with program execution is known to be the right
    thing to do.

    For example:

    ```python3
    from contextlib import suppress

    with suppress(FileNotFoundError):
        os.remove('somefile.tmp')

    with suppress(FileNotFoundError):
        os.remove('someotherfile.tmp')
    ```

    This code is equivalent to:

    ```python3
    try:
        os.remove('somefile.tmp')
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass

    try:
        os.remove('someotherfile.tmp')
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
    ```

    This context manager is [reentrant](contextlib.md#reentrant-cms).

    If the code within the `with` block raises a
    [`BaseExceptionGroup`](exceptions.md#BaseExceptionGroup "BaseExceptionGroup"), suppressed exceptions are removed from the
    group. Any exceptions of the group which are not suppressed are re-raised in
    a new group which is created using the original group’s [`derive()`](exceptions.md#BaseExceptionGroup.derive "BaseExceptionGroup.derive")
    method.

    Added in version 3.4.

    Changed in version 3.12: `suppress` now supports suppressing exceptions raised as
    part of a [`BaseExceptionGroup`](exceptions.md#BaseExceptionGroup "BaseExceptionGroup").

`contextlib.redirect_stdout(new_target)`
:   Context manager for temporarily redirecting [`sys.stdout`](sys.md#sys.stdout "sys.stdout") to
    another file or file-like object.

    This tool adds flexibility to existing functions or classes whose output
    is hardwired to stdout.

    For example, the output of [`help()`](functions.md#help "help") normally is sent to *sys.stdout*.
    You can capture that output in a string by redirecting the output to an
    [`io.StringIO`](io.md#io.StringIO "io.StringIO") object. The replacement stream is returned from the
    `__enter__` method and so is available as the target of the
    [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement:

    ```python3
    with redirect_stdout(io.StringIO()) as f:
        help(pow)
    s = f.getvalue()
    ```

    To send the output of [`help()`](functions.md#help "help") to a file on disk, redirect the output
    to a regular file:

    ```python3
    with open('help.txt', 'w') as f:
        with redirect_stdout(f):
            help(pow)
    ```

    To send the output of [`help()`](functions.md#help "help") to *sys.stderr*:

    ```python3
    with redirect_stdout(sys.stderr):
        help(pow)
    ```

    Note that the global side effect on [`sys.stdout`](sys.md#sys.stdout "sys.stdout") means that this
    context manager is not suitable for use in library code and most threaded
    applications. It also has no effect on the output of subprocesses.
    However, it is still a useful approach for many utility scripts.

    This context manager is [reentrant](contextlib.md#reentrant-cms).

    Added in version 3.4.

`contextlib.redirect_stderr(new_target)`
:   Similar to [`redirect_stdout()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.redirect_stdout "contextlib.redirect_stdout") but redirecting
    [`sys.stderr`](sys.md#sys.stderr "sys.stderr") to another file or file-like object.

    This context manager is [reentrant](contextlib.md#reentrant-cms).

    Added in version 3.5.

`contextlib.chdir(path)`
:   Non parallel-safe context manager to change the current working directory.
    As this changes a global state, the working directory, it is not suitable
    for use in most threaded or async contexts. It is also not suitable for most
    non-linear code execution, like generators, where the program execution is
    temporarily relinquished – unless explicitly desired, you should not yield
    when this context manager is active.

    This is a simple wrapper around [`chdir()`](os.md#os.chdir "os.chdir"), it changes the current
    working directory upon entering and restores the old one on exit.

    This context manager is [reentrant](contextlib.md#reentrant-cms).

    Added in version 3.11.

`class contextlib.ContextDecorator`
:   A base class that enables a context manager to also be used as a decorator.

    Context managers inheriting from `ContextDecorator` have to implement
    `__enter__` and `__exit__` as normal. `__exit__` retains its optional
    exception handling even when used as a decorator.

    `ContextDecorator` is used by [`contextmanager()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.contextmanager "contextlib.contextmanager"), so you get this
    functionality automatically.

    Example of `ContextDecorator`:

    ```python3
    from contextlib import ContextDecorator

    class mycontext(ContextDecorator):
        def __enter__(self):
            print('Starting')
            return self

        def __exit__(self, *exc):
            print('Finishing')
            return False
    ```

    The class can then be used like this:

    ```python3
    >>> @mycontext()
    ... def function():
    ...     print('The bit in the middle')
    ...
    >>> function()
    Starting
    The bit in the middle
    Finishing

    >>> with mycontext():
    ...     print('The bit in the middle')
    ...
    Starting
    The bit in the middle
    Finishing
    ```

    This change is just syntactic sugar for any construct of the following form:

    ```python3
    def f():
        with cm():
            # Do stuff
    ```

    `ContextDecorator` lets you instead write:

    ```python3
    @cm()
    def f():
        # Do stuff
    ```

    It makes it clear that the `cm` applies to the whole function, rather than
    just a piece of it (and saving an indentation level is nice, too).

    Existing context managers that already have a base class can be extended by
    using `ContextDecorator` as a mixin class:

    ```python3
    from contextlib import ContextDecorator

    class mycontext(ContextBaseClass, ContextDecorator):
        def __enter__(self):
            return self

        def __exit__(self, *exc):
            return False
    ```

    > **Note:**
    >
    > As the decorated function must be able to be called multiple times, the
    > underlying context manager must support use in multiple [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with)
    > statements. If this is not the case, then the original construct with the
    > explicit `with` statement inside the function should be used.

    Added in version 3.2.

`class contextlib.AsyncContextDecorator`
:   Similar to [`ContextDecorator`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ContextDecorator "contextlib.ContextDecorator") but only for asynchronous functions.

    Example of `AsyncContextDecorator`:

    ```python3
    from asyncio import run
    from contextlib import AsyncContextDecorator

    class mycontext(AsyncContextDecorator):
        async def __aenter__(self):
            print('Starting')
            return self

        async def __aexit__(self, *exc):
            print('Finishing')
            return False
    ```

    The class can then be used like this:

    ```python3
    >>> @mycontext()
    ... async def function():
    ...     print('The bit in the middle')
    ...
    >>> run(function())
    Starting
    The bit in the middle
    Finishing

    >>> async def function():
    ...    async with mycontext():
    ...         print('The bit in the middle')
    ...
    >>> run(function())
    Starting
    The bit in the middle
    Finishing
    ```

    Added in version 3.10.

`class contextlib.ExitStack`
:   A context manager that is designed to make it easy to programmatically
    combine other context managers and cleanup functions, especially those
    that are optional or otherwise driven by input data.

    For example, a set of files may easily be handled in a single with
    statement as follows:

    ```python3
    with ExitStack() as stack:
        files = [stack.enter_context(open(fname)) for fname in filenames]
        # All opened files will automatically be closed at the end of
        # the with statement, even if attempts to open files later
        # in the list raise an exception
    ```

    The [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") method returns the [`ExitStack`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack "contextlib.ExitStack") instance, and
    performs no additional operations.

    Each instance maintains a stack of registered callbacks that are called in
    reverse order when the instance is closed (either explicitly or implicitly
    at the end of a [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement). Note that callbacks are *not*
    invoked implicitly when the context stack instance is garbage collected.

    This stack model is used so that context managers that acquire their
    resources in their `__init__` method (such as file objects) can be
    handled correctly.

    Since registered callbacks are invoked in the reverse order of
    registration, this ends up behaving as if multiple nested [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with)
    statements had been used with the registered set of callbacks. This even
    extends to exception handling - if an inner callback suppresses or replaces
    an exception, then outer callbacks will be passed arguments based on that
    updated state.

    This is a relatively low level API that takes care of the details of
    correctly unwinding the stack of exit callbacks. It provides a suitable
    foundation for higher level context managers that manipulate the exit
    stack in application specific ways.

    Added in version 3.3.

    `enter_context(cm)`
    :   Enters a new context manager and adds its [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") method to
        the callback stack. The return value is the result of the context
        manager’s own [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") method.

        These context managers may suppress exceptions just as they normally
        would if used directly as part of a [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement.

        Changed in version 3.11: Raises [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError "TypeError") instead of [`AttributeError`](exceptions.md#AttributeError "AttributeError") if *cm*
        is not a context manager.

    `push(exit)`
    :   Adds a context manager’s [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") method to the callback stack.

        As `__enter__` is *not* invoked, this method can be used to cover
        part of an [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") implementation with a context manager’s own
        [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") method.

        If passed an object that is not a context manager, this method assumes
        it is a callback with the same signature as a context manager’s
        [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") method and adds it directly to the callback stack.

        By returning true values, these callbacks can suppress exceptions the
        same way context manager [`__exit__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__exit__ "object.__exit__") methods can.

        The passed in object is returned from the function, allowing this
        method to be used as a function decorator.

    `callback(callback, /, *args, **kwds)`
    :   Accepts an arbitrary callback function and arguments and adds it to
        the callback stack.

        Unlike the other methods, callbacks added this way cannot suppress
        exceptions (as they are never passed the exception details).

        The passed in callback is returned from the function, allowing this
        method to be used as a function decorator.

    `pop_all()`
    :   Transfers the callback stack to a fresh [`ExitStack`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack "contextlib.ExitStack") instance
        and returns it. No callbacks are invoked by this operation - instead,
        they will now be invoked when the new stack is closed (either
        explicitly or implicitly at the end of a [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement).

        For example, a group of files can be opened as an “all or nothing”
        operation as follows:

        ```python3
        with ExitStack() as stack:
            files = [stack.enter_context(open(fname)) for fname in filenames]
            # Hold onto the close method, but don't call it yet.
            close_files = stack.pop_all().close
            # If opening any file fails, all previously opened files will be
            # closed automatically. If all files are opened successfully,
            # they will remain open even after the with statement ends.
            # close_files() can then be invoked explicitly to close them all.
        ```

    `close()`
    :   Immediately unwinds the callback stack, invoking callbacks in the
        reverse order of registration. For any context managers and exit
        callbacks registered, the arguments passed in will indicate that no
        exception occurred.

`class contextlib.AsyncExitStack`
:   An [asynchronous context manager](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#async-context-managers), similar
    to [`ExitStack`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack "contextlib.ExitStack"), that supports combining both synchronous and
    asynchronous context managers, as well as having coroutines for
    cleanup logic.

    The [`close()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack.close "contextlib.ExitStack.close") method is not implemented; [`aclose()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.AsyncExitStack.aclose "contextlib.AsyncExitStack.aclose") must be used
    instead.

    `async enter_async_context(cm)`
    :   Similar to [`ExitStack.enter_context()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack.enter_context "contextlib.ExitStack.enter_context") but expects an asynchronous context
        manager.

        Changed in version 3.11: Raises [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError "TypeError") instead of [`AttributeError`](exceptions.md#AttributeError "AttributeError") if *cm*
        is not an asynchronous context manager.

    `push_async_exit(exit)`
    :   Similar to [`ExitStack.push()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack.push "contextlib.ExitStack.push") but expects either an asynchronous context manager
        or a coroutine function.

    `push_async_callback(callback, /, *args, **kwds)`
    :   Similar to [`ExitStack.callback()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack.callback "contextlib.ExitStack.callback") but expects a coroutine function.

    `async aclose()`
    :   Similar to [`ExitStack.close()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack.close "contextlib.ExitStack.close") but properly handles awaitables.

    Continuing the example for [`asynccontextmanager()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.asynccontextmanager "contextlib.asynccontextmanager"):

    ```python3
    async with AsyncExitStack() as stack:
        connections = [await stack.enter_async_context(get_connection())
            for i in range(5)]
        # All opened connections will automatically be released at the end of
        # the async with statement, even if attempts to open a connection
        # later in the list raise an exception.
    ```

    Added in version 3.7.

## Examples and Recipes

This section describes some examples and recipes for making effective use of
the tools provided by [`contextlib`](contextlib.md#module-contextlib "contextlib: Utilities for with-statement contexts.").

### Supporting a variable number of context managers

The primary use case for [`ExitStack`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack "contextlib.ExitStack") is the one given in the class
documentation: supporting a variable number of context managers and other
cleanup operations in a single [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement. The variability
may come from the number of context managers needed being driven by user
input (such as opening a user specified collection of files), or from
some of the context managers being optional:

```python3
with ExitStack() as stack:
    for resource in resources:
        stack.enter_context(resource)
    if need_special_resource():
        special = acquire_special_resource()
        stack.callback(release_special_resource, special)
    # Perform operations that use the acquired resources
```

As shown, [`ExitStack`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack "contextlib.ExitStack") also makes it quite easy to use [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with)
statements to manage arbitrary resources that don’t natively support the
context management protocol.

### Catching exceptions from `__enter__` methods

It is occasionally desirable to catch exceptions from an `__enter__`
method implementation, *without* inadvertently catching exceptions from
the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement body or the context manager’s `__exit__`
method. By using [`ExitStack`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack "contextlib.ExitStack") the steps in the context management
protocol can be separated slightly in order to allow this:

```python3
stack = ExitStack()
try:
    x = stack.enter_context(cm)
except Exception:
    # handle __enter__ exception
else:
    with stack:
        # Handle normal case
```

Actually needing to do this is likely to indicate that the underlying API
should be providing a direct resource management interface for use with
[`try`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#try)/[`except`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#except)/[`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) statements, but not
all APIs are well designed in that regard. When a context manager is the
only resource management API provided, then [`ExitStack`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack "contextlib.ExitStack") can make it
easier to handle various situations that can’t be handled directly in a
[`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement.

### Cleaning up in an `__enter__` implementation

As noted in the documentation of [`ExitStack.push()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack.push "contextlib.ExitStack.push"), this
method can be useful in cleaning up an already allocated resource if later
steps in the [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__") implementation fail.

Here’s an example of doing this for a context manager that accepts resource
acquisition and release functions, along with an optional validation function,
and maps them to the context management protocol:

```python3
from contextlib import contextmanager, AbstractContextManager, ExitStack

class ResourceManager(AbstractContextManager):

    def __init__(self, acquire_resource, release_resource, check_resource_ok=None):
        self.acquire_resource = acquire_resource
        self.release_resource = release_resource
        if check_resource_ok is None:
            def check_resource_ok(resource):
                return True
        self.check_resource_ok = check_resource_ok

    @contextmanager
    def _cleanup_on_error(self):
        with ExitStack() as stack:
            stack.push(self)
            yield
            # The validation check passed and didn't raise an exception
            # Accordingly, we want to keep the resource, and pass it
            # back to our caller
            stack.pop_all()

    def __enter__(self):
        resource = self.acquire_resource()
        with self._cleanup_on_error():
            if not self.check_resource_ok(resource):
                msg = "Failed validation for {!r}"
                raise RuntimeError(msg.format(resource))
        return resource

    def __exit__(self, *exc_details):
        # We don't need to duplicate any of our resource release logic
        self.release_resource()
```

### Replacing any use of `try-finally` and flag variables

A pattern you will sometimes see is a `try-finally` statement with a flag
variable to indicate whether or not the body of the `finally` clause should
be executed. In its simplest form (that can’t already be handled just by
using an `except` clause instead), it looks something like this:

```python3
cleanup_needed = True
try:
    result = perform_operation()
    if result:
        cleanup_needed = False
finally:
    if cleanup_needed:
        cleanup_resources()
```

As with any `try` statement based code, this can cause problems for
development and review, because the setup code and the cleanup code can end
up being separated by arbitrarily long sections of code.

[`ExitStack`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack "contextlib.ExitStack") makes it possible to instead register a callback for
execution at the end of a `with` statement, and then later decide to skip
executing that callback:

```python3
from contextlib import ExitStack

with ExitStack() as stack:
    stack.callback(cleanup_resources)
    result = perform_operation()
    if result:
        stack.pop_all()
```

This allows the intended cleanup behaviour to be made explicit up front,
rather than requiring a separate flag variable.

If a particular application uses this pattern a lot, it can be simplified
even further by means of a small helper class:

```python3
from contextlib import ExitStack

class Callback(ExitStack):
    def __init__(self, callback, /, *args, **kwds):
        super().__init__()
        self.callback(callback, *args, **kwds)

    def cancel(self):
        self.pop_all()

with Callback(cleanup_resources) as cb:
    result = perform_operation()
    if result:
        cb.cancel()
```

If the resource cleanup isn’t already neatly bundled into a standalone
function, then it is still possible to use the decorator form of
[`ExitStack.callback()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack.callback "contextlib.ExitStack.callback") to declare the resource cleanup in
advance:

```python3
from contextlib import ExitStack

with ExitStack() as stack:
    @stack.callback
    def cleanup_resources():
        ...
    result = perform_operation()
    if result:
        stack.pop_all()
```

Due to the way the decorator protocol works, a callback function
declared this way cannot take any parameters. Instead, any resources to
be released must be accessed as closure variables.

### Using a context manager as a function decorator

[`ContextDecorator`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ContextDecorator "contextlib.ContextDecorator") makes it possible to use a context manager in
both an ordinary `with` statement and also as a function decorator.

For example, it is sometimes useful to wrap functions or groups of statements
with a logger that can track the time of entry and time of exit. Rather than
writing both a function decorator and a context manager for the task,
inheriting from [`ContextDecorator`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ContextDecorator "contextlib.ContextDecorator") provides both capabilities in a
single definition:

```python3
from contextlib import ContextDecorator
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class track_entry_and_exit(ContextDecorator):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __enter__(self):
        logging.info('Entering: %s', self.name)

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc, exc_tb):
        logging.info('Exiting: %s', self.name)
```

Instances of this class can be used as both a context manager:

```python3
with track_entry_and_exit('widget loader'):
    print('Some time consuming activity goes here')
    load_widget()
```

And also as a function decorator:

```python3
@track_entry_and_exit('widget loader')
def activity():
    print('Some time consuming activity goes here')
    load_widget()
```

Note that there is one additional limitation when using context managers
as function decorators: there’s no way to access the return value of
[`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__ "object.__enter__"). If that value is needed, then it is still necessary to use
an explicit `with` statement.

> **See also:**
>
> [**PEP 343**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0343/) - The “with” statement
> :   The specification, background, and examples for the Python [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with)
>     statement.

## Single use, reusable and reentrant context managers

Most context managers are written in a way that means they can only be
used effectively in a [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement once. These single use
context managers must be created afresh each time they’re used -
attempting to use them a second time will trigger an exception or
otherwise not work correctly.

This common limitation means that it is generally advisable to create
context managers directly in the header of the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement
where they are used (as shown in all of the usage examples above).

Files are an example of effectively single use context managers, since
the first [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement will close the file, preventing any
further IO operations using that file object.

Context managers created using [`contextmanager()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.contextmanager "contextlib.contextmanager") are also single use
context managers, and will complain about the underlying generator failing
to yield if an attempt is made to use them a second time:

```python3
>>> from contextlib import contextmanager
>>> @contextmanager
... def singleuse():
...     print("Before")
...     yield
...     print("After")
...
>>> cm = singleuse()
>>> with cm:
...     pass
...
Before
After
>>> with cm:
...     pass
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
RuntimeError: generator didn't yield
```

### Reentrant context managers

More sophisticated context managers may be “reentrant”. These context
managers can not only be used in multiple [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statements,
but may also be used *inside* a `with` statement that is already
using the same context manager.

[`threading.RLock`](threading.md#threading.RLock "threading.RLock") is an example of a reentrant context manager, as are
[`suppress()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.suppress "contextlib.suppress"), [`redirect_stdout()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.redirect_stdout "contextlib.redirect_stdout"), and [`chdir()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.chdir "contextlib.chdir"). Here’s a very
simple example of reentrant use:

```python3
>>> from contextlib import redirect_stdout
>>> from io import StringIO
>>> stream = StringIO()
>>> write_to_stream = redirect_stdout(stream)
>>> with write_to_stream:
...     print("This is written to the stream rather than stdout")
...     with write_to_stream:
...         print("This is also written to the stream")
...
>>> print("This is written directly to stdout")
This is written directly to stdout
>>> print(stream.getvalue())
This is written to the stream rather than stdout
This is also written to the stream
```

Real world examples of reentrancy are more likely to involve multiple
functions calling each other and hence be far more complicated than this
example.

Note also that being reentrant is *not* the same thing as being thread safe.
[`redirect_stdout()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.redirect_stdout "contextlib.redirect_stdout"), for example, is definitely not thread safe, as it
makes a global modification to the system state by binding [`sys.stdout`](sys.md#sys.stdout "sys.stdout")
to a different stream.

### Reusable context managers

Distinct from both single use and reentrant context managers are “reusable”
context managers (or, to be completely explicit, “reusable, but not
reentrant” context managers, since reentrant context managers are also
reusable). These context managers support being used multiple times, but
will fail (or otherwise not work correctly) if the specific context manager
instance has already been used in a containing with statement.

[`threading.Lock`](threading.md#threading.Lock "threading.Lock") is an example of a reusable, but not reentrant,
context manager (for a reentrant lock, it is necessary to use
[`threading.RLock`](threading.md#threading.RLock "threading.RLock") instead).

Another example of a reusable, but not reentrant, context manager is
[`ExitStack`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack "contextlib.ExitStack"), as it invokes *all* currently registered callbacks
when leaving any with statement, regardless of where those callbacks
were added:

```python3
>>> from contextlib import ExitStack
>>> stack = ExitStack()
>>> with stack:
...     stack.callback(print, "Callback: from first context")
...     print("Leaving first context")
...
Leaving first context
Callback: from first context
>>> with stack:
...     stack.callback(print, "Callback: from second context")
...     print("Leaving second context")
...
Leaving second context
Callback: from second context
>>> with stack:
...     stack.callback(print, "Callback: from outer context")
...     with stack:
...         stack.callback(print, "Callback: from inner context")
...         print("Leaving inner context")
...     print("Leaving outer context")
...
Leaving inner context
Callback: from inner context
Callback: from outer context
Leaving outer context
```

As the output from the example shows, reusing a single stack object across
multiple with statements works correctly, but attempting to nest them
will cause the stack to be cleared at the end of the innermost with
statement, which is unlikely to be desirable behaviour.

Using separate [`ExitStack`](contextlib.md#contextlib.ExitStack "contextlib.ExitStack") instances instead of reusing a single
instance avoids that problem:

```python3
>>> from contextlib import ExitStack
>>> with ExitStack() as outer_stack:
...     outer_stack.callback(print, "Callback: from outer context")
...     with ExitStack() as inner_stack:
...         inner_stack.callback(print, "Callback: from inner context")
...         print("Leaving inner context")
...     print("Leaving outer context")
...
Leaving inner context
Callback: from inner context
Leaving outer context
Callback: from outer context
```
