# `email.errors`: Exception and Defect classes

**Source code:** [Lib/email/errors.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/email/errors.py)

---

The following exception classes are defined in the [`email.errors`](email.errors.md#module-email.errors "email.errors: The exception classes used by the email package.") module:

`exception email.errors.MessageError`
:   This is the base class for all exceptions that the [`email`](email.md#module-email "email: Package supporting the parsing, manipulating, and generating email messages.") package can
    raise. It is derived from the standard [`Exception`](exceptions.md#Exception "Exception") class and defines no
    additional methods.

`exception email.errors.MessageParseError`
:   This is the base class for exceptions raised by the
    [`Parser`](email.parser.md#email.parser.Parser "email.parser.Parser") class. It is derived from
    [`MessageError`](email.errors.md#email.errors.MessageError "email.errors.MessageError"). This class is also used internally by the parser used
    by [`headerregistry`](email.headerregistry.md#module-email.headerregistry "email.headerregistry: Automatic Parsing of headers based on the field name").

`exception email.errors.HeaderParseError`
:   Raised under some error conditions when parsing the [**RFC 5322**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322.html) headers of a
    message, this class is derived from [`MessageParseError`](email.errors.md#email.errors.MessageParseError "email.errors.MessageParseError"). The
    [`set_boundary()`](email.message.md#email.message.EmailMessage.set_boundary "email.message.EmailMessage.set_boundary") method will raise this
    error if the content type is unknown when the method is called.
    [`Header`](email.header.md#email.header.Header "email.header.Header") may raise this error for certain base64
    decoding errors, and when an attempt is made to create a header that appears
    to contain an embedded header (that is, there is what is supposed to be a
    continuation line that has no leading whitespace and looks like a header).

`exception email.errors.BoundaryError`
:   Deprecated and no longer used.

`exception email.errors.MultipartConversionError`
:   Raised if the [`attach()`](email.compat32-message.md#email.message.Message.attach "email.message.Message.attach") method is called
    on an instance of a class derived from
    [`MIMENonMultipart`](email.mime.md#email.mime.nonmultipart.MIMENonMultipart "email.mime.nonmultipart.MIMENonMultipart") (e.g.
    [`MIMEImage`](email.mime.md#email.mime.image.MIMEImage "email.mime.image.MIMEImage")).
    [`MultipartConversionError`](email.errors.md#email.errors.MultipartConversionError "email.errors.MultipartConversionError") multiply
    inherits from [`MessageError`](email.errors.md#email.errors.MessageError "email.errors.MessageError") and the built-in [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError "TypeError").

`exception email.errors.HeaderWriteError`
:   Raised when an error occurs when the [`generator`](email.generator.md#module-email.generator "email.generator: Generate flat text email messages from a message structure.") outputs
    headers.

`exception email.errors.MessageDefect`
:   This is the base class for all defects found when parsing email messages.
    It is derived from [`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError "ValueError").

`exception email.errors.HeaderDefect`
:   This is the base class for all defects found when parsing email headers.
    It is derived from [`MessageDefect`](email.errors.md#email.errors.MessageDefect "email.errors.MessageDefect").

Here is the list of the defects that the [`FeedParser`](email.parser.md#email.parser.FeedParser "email.parser.FeedParser")
can find while parsing messages. Note that the defects are added to the message
where the problem was found, so for example, if a message nested inside a
*multipart/alternative* had a malformed header, that nested message
object would have a defect, but the containing messages would not.

All defect classes are subclassed from [`email.errors.MessageDefect`](email.errors.md#email.errors.MessageDefect "email.errors.MessageDefect").

`exception email.errors.NoBoundaryInMultipartDefect`
:   A message claimed to be a multipart, but had no *boundary*
    parameter.

`exception email.errors.StartBoundaryNotFoundDefect`
:   The start boundary claimed in the *Content-Type* header was
    never found.

`exception email.errors.CloseBoundaryNotFoundDefect`
:   A start boundary was found, but no corresponding close boundary was ever
    found.

    Added in version 3.3.

`exception email.errors.FirstHeaderLineIsContinuationDefect`
:   The message had a continuation line as its first header line.

`exception email.errors.MisplacedEnvelopeHeaderDefect`
:   A “Unix From” header was found in the middle of a header block.

`exception email.errors.MissingHeaderBodySeparatorDefect`
:   A line was found while parsing headers that had no leading white space but
    contained no ‘:’. Parsing continues assuming that the line represents the
    first line of the body.

    Added in version 3.3.

`exception email.errors.MalformedHeaderDefect`
:   A header was found that was missing a colon, or was otherwise malformed.

    Deprecated since version 3.3: This defect has not been used for several Python versions.

`exception email.errors.MultipartInvariantViolationDefect`
:   A message claimed to be a *multipart*, but no subparts were found.
    Note that when a message has this defect, its
    [`is_multipart()`](email.compat32-message.md#email.message.Message.is_multipart "email.message.Message.is_multipart") method may return `False`
    even though its content type claims to be *multipart*.

`exception email.errors.InvalidBase64PaddingDefect`
:   When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, the padding was not correct.
    Enough padding is added to perform the decode, but the resulting decoded
    bytes may be invalid.

`exception email.errors.InvalidBase64CharactersDefect`
:   When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, characters outside the base64
    alphabet were encountered. The characters are ignored, but the resulting
    decoded bytes may be invalid.

`exception email.errors.InvalidBase64LengthDefect`
:   When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, the number of non-padding
    base64 characters was invalid (1 more than a multiple of 4). The encoded
    block was kept as-is.

`exception email.errors.InvalidDateDefect`
:   When decoding an invalid or unparsable date field. The original value is
    kept as-is.
