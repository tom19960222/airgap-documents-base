# `os.path` — Common pathname manipulations

**Source code:** [Lib/genericpath.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/genericpath.py), [Lib/posixpath.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/posixpath.py) (for POSIX) and
[Lib/ntpath.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/ntpath.py) (for Windows).

---

This module implements some useful functions on pathnames. To read or write
files see [`open()`](functions.md#open "open"), and for accessing the filesystem see the [`os`](os.md#module-os "os: Miscellaneous operating system interfaces.")
module. The path parameters can be passed as strings, or bytes, or any object
implementing the [`os.PathLike`](os.md#os.PathLike "os.PathLike") protocol.

Unlike a Unix shell, Python does not do any *automatic* path expansions.
Functions such as [`expanduser()`](os.path.md#os.path.expanduser "os.path.expanduser") and [`expandvars()`](os.path.md#os.path.expandvars "os.path.expandvars") can be invoked
explicitly when an application desires shell-like path expansion. (See also
the [`glob`](glob.md#module-glob "glob: Unix shell style pathname pattern expansion.") module.)

> **See also:**
>
> The [`pathlib`](pathlib.md#module-pathlib "pathlib: Object-oriented filesystem paths") module offers high-level path objects.

> **Note:**
>
> All of these functions accept either only bytes or only string objects as
> their parameters. The result is an object of the same type, if a path or
> file name is returned.

> **Note:**
>
> Since different operating systems have different path name conventions, there
> are several versions of this module in the standard library. The
> [`os.path`](os.path.md#module-os.path "os.path: Operations on pathnames.") module is always the path module suitable for the operating
> system Python is running on, and therefore usable for local paths. However,
> you can also import and use the individual modules if you want to manipulate
> a path that is *always* in one of the different formats. They all have the
> same interface:
>
> - `posixpath` for UNIX-style paths
> - `ntpath` for Windows paths

Changed in version 3.8: [`exists()`](os.path.md#os.path.exists "os.path.exists"), [`lexists()`](os.path.md#os.path.lexists "os.path.lexists"), [`isdir()`](os.path.md#os.path.isdir "os.path.isdir"), [`isfile()`](os.path.md#os.path.isfile "os.path.isfile"),
[`islink()`](os.path.md#os.path.islink "os.path.islink"), and [`ismount()`](os.path.md#os.path.ismount "os.path.ismount") now return `False` instead of
raising an exception for paths that contain characters or bytes
unrepresentable at the OS level.

`os.path.abspath(path)`
:   Return a normalized absolutized version of the pathname *path*. On most
    platforms, this is equivalent to calling the function [`normpath()`](os.path.md#os.path.normpath "os.path.normpath") as
    follows: `normpath(join(os.getcwd(), path))`.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.basename(path)`
:   Return the base name of pathname *path*. This is the second element of the
    pair returned by passing *path* to the function [`split()`](os.path.md#os.path.split "os.path.split"). Note that
    the result of this function is different
    from the Unix **basename** program; where **basename** for
    `'/foo/bar/'` returns `'bar'`, the [`basename()`](os.path.md#os.path.basename "os.path.basename") function returns an
    empty string (`''`).

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.commonpath(paths)`
:   Return the longest common sub-path of each pathname in the sequence
    *paths*. Raise [`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError "ValueError") if *paths* contain both absolute
    and relative pathnames, if *paths* are on different drives, or
    if *paths* is empty. Unlike [`commonprefix()`](os.path.md#os.path.commonprefix "os.path.commonprefix"), this returns a
    valid path.

    Added in version 3.5.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a sequence of [path-like objects](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.commonprefix(list)`
:   Return the longest string prefix (taken character-by-character) that is a
    prefix of all strings in *list*. If *list* is empty, return the empty string
    (`''`).

    > **Warning:**
    >
    > This function may return invalid paths because it works a
    > character at a time.
    > If you need a **common path prefix**, then the algorithm
    > implemented in this function is not secure. Use
    > [`commonpath()`](os.path.md#os.path.commonpath "os.path.commonpath") for finding a common path prefix.
    >
    > ```python3
    > >>> os.path.commonprefix(['/usr/lib', '/usr/local/lib'])
    > '/usr/l'
    >
    > >>> os.path.commonpath(['/usr/lib', '/usr/local/lib'])
    > '/usr'
    > ```

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.dirname(path)`
:   Return the directory name of pathname *path*. This is the first element of
    the pair returned by passing *path* to the function [`split()`](os.path.md#os.path.split "os.path.split").

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.exists(path)`
:   Return `True` if *path* refers to an existing path or an open
    file descriptor. Returns `False` for broken symbolic links. On
    some platforms, this function may return `False` if permission is
    not granted to execute [`os.stat()`](os.md#os.stat "os.stat") on the requested file, even
    if the *path* physically exists.

    Changed in version 3.3: *path* can now be an integer: `True` is returned if it is an
    open file descriptor, `False` otherwise.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.lexists(path)`
:   Return `True` if *path* refers to an existing path, including
    broken symbolic links. Equivalent to [`exists()`](os.path.md#os.path.exists "os.path.exists") on platforms lacking
    [`os.lstat()`](os.md#os.lstat "os.lstat").

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.expanduser(path)`
:   On Unix and Windows, return the argument with an initial component of `~` or
    `~user` replaced by that *user*’s home directory.

    On Unix, an initial `~` is replaced by the environment variable `HOME`
    if it is set; otherwise the current user’s home directory is looked up in the
    password directory through the built-in module [`pwd`](pwd.md#module-pwd "pwd: The password database (getpwnam() and friends). (Unix)"). An initial `~user`
    is looked up directly in the password directory.

    On Windows, `USERPROFILE` will be used if set, otherwise a combination
    of `HOMEPATH` and `HOMEDRIVE` will be used. An initial
    `~user` is handled by checking that the last directory component of the current
    user’s home directory matches `USERNAME`, and replacing it if so.

    If the expansion fails or if the path does not begin with a tilde, the path is
    returned unchanged.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

    Changed in version 3.8: No longer uses `HOME` on Windows.

`os.path.expandvars(path)`
:   Return the argument with environment variables expanded. Substrings of the form
    `$name` or `${name}` are replaced by the value of environment variable
    *name*. Malformed variable names and references to non-existing variables are
    left unchanged.

    On Windows, `%name%` expansions are supported in addition to `$name` and
    `${name}`.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.getatime(path)`
:   Return the time of last access of *path*. The return value is a floating-point number giving
    the number of seconds since the epoch (see the [`time`](time.md#module-time "time: Time access and conversions.") module). Raise
    [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError "OSError") if the file does not exist or is inaccessible.

`os.path.getmtime(path)`
:   Return the time of last modification of *path*. The return value is a floating-point number
    giving the number of seconds since the epoch (see the [`time`](time.md#module-time "time: Time access and conversions.") module).
    Raise [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError "OSError") if the file does not exist or is inaccessible.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.getctime(path)`
:   Return the system’s ctime which, on some systems (like Unix) is the time of the
    last metadata change, and, on others (like Windows), is the creation time for *path*.
    The return value is a number giving the number of seconds since the epoch (see
    the [`time`](time.md#module-time "time: Time access and conversions.") module). Raise [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError "OSError") if the file does not exist or
    is inaccessible.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.getsize(path)`
:   Return the size, in bytes, of *path*. Raise [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError "OSError") if the file does
    not exist or is inaccessible.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.isabs(path)`
:   Return `True` if *path* is an absolute pathname. On Unix, that means it
    begins with a slash, on Windows that it begins with a (back)slash after chopping
    off a potential drive letter.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.isfile(path)`
:   Return `True` if *path* is an [`existing`](os.path.md#os.path.exists "os.path.exists") regular file.
    This follows symbolic links, so both [`islink()`](os.path.md#os.path.islink "os.path.islink") and [`isfile()`](os.path.md#os.path.isfile "os.path.isfile") can
    be true for the same path.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.isdir(path)`
:   Return `True` if *path* is an [`existing`](os.path.md#os.path.exists "os.path.exists") directory. This
    follows symbolic links, so both [`islink()`](os.path.md#os.path.islink "os.path.islink") and [`isdir()`](os.path.md#os.path.isdir "os.path.isdir") can be true
    for the same path.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.isjunction(path)`
:   Return `True` if *path* refers to an [`existing`](os.path.md#os.path.lexists "os.path.lexists") directory
    entry that is a junction. Always return `False` if junctions are not
    supported on the current platform.

    Added in version 3.12.

`os.path.islink(path)`
:   Return `True` if *path* refers to an [`existing`](os.path.md#os.path.exists "os.path.exists") directory
    entry that is a symbolic link. Always `False` if symbolic links are not
    supported by the Python runtime.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.ismount(path)`
:   Return `True` if pathname *path* is a *mount point*: a point in a
    file system where a different file system has been mounted. On POSIX, the
    function checks whether *path*’s parent, `path/..`, is on a different
    device than *path*, or whether `path/..` and *path* point to the same
    i-node on the same device — this should detect mount points for all Unix
    and POSIX variants. It is not able to reliably detect bind mounts on the
    same filesystem. On Windows, a drive letter root and a share UNC are
    always mount points, and for any other path `GetVolumePathName` is called
    to see if it is different from the input path.

    Changed in version 3.4: Added support for detecting non-root mount points on Windows.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.isdevdrive(path)`
:   Return `True` if pathname *path* is located on a Windows Dev Drive.
    A Dev Drive is optimized for developer scenarios, and offers faster
    performance for reading and writing files. It is recommended for use for
    source code, temporary build directories, package caches, and other
    IO-intensive operations.

    May raise an error for an invalid path, for example, one without a
    recognizable drive, but returns `False` on platforms that do not support
    Dev Drives. See [the Windows documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/dev-drive/)
    for information on enabling and creating Dev Drives.

    [Availability](intro.md#availability): Windows.

    Added in version 3.12.

`os.path.join(path, *paths)`
:   Join one or more path segments intelligently. The return value is the
    concatenation of *path* and all members of *\*paths*, with exactly one
    directory separator following each non-empty part, except the last. That is,
    the result will only end in a separator if the last part is either empty or
    ends in a separator. If a segment is an absolute path (which on Windows
    requires both a drive and a root), then all previous segments are ignored and
    joining continues from the absolute path segment.

    On Windows, the drive is not reset when a rooted path segment (e.g.,
    `r'\foo'`) is encountered. If a segment is on a different drive or is an
    absolute path, all previous segments are ignored and the drive is reset. Note
    that since there is a current directory for each drive,
    `os.path.join("c:", "foo")` represents a path relative to the current
    directory on drive `C:` (`c:foo`), not `c:\foo`.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object) for *path* and *paths*.

`os.path.normcase(path)`
:   Normalize the case of a pathname. On Windows, convert all characters in the
    pathname to lowercase, and also convert forward slashes to backward slashes.
    On other operating systems, return the path unchanged.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.normpath(path)`
:   Normalize a pathname by collapsing redundant separators and up-level
    references so that `A//B`, `A/B/`, `A/./B` and `A/foo/../B` all
    become `A/B`. This string manipulation may change the meaning of a path
    that contains symbolic links. On Windows, it converts forward slashes to
    backward slashes. To normalize case, use [`normcase()`](os.path.md#os.path.normcase "os.path.normcase").

    > **Note:**
    >
    > On POSIX systems, in accordance with [IEEE Std 1003.1 2013 Edition; 4.13
    > Pathname Resolution](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_13),
    > if a pathname begins with exactly two slashes, the first component
    > following the leading characters may be interpreted in an implementation-defined
    > manner, although more than two leading characters shall be treated as a
    > single character.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.realpath(path, *, strict=False)`
:   Return the canonical path of the specified filename, eliminating any symbolic
    links encountered in the path (if they are supported by the operating
    system).

    By default, the path is evaluated up to the first component that does not
    exist, is a symlink loop, or whose evaluation raises [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError "OSError").
    All such components are appended unchanged to the existing part of the path.

    Some errors that are handled this way include “access denied”, “not a
    directory”, or “bad argument to internal function”. Thus, the
    resulting path may be missing or inaccessible, may still contain
    links or loops, and may traverse non-directories.

    This behavior can be modified by keyword arguments:

    If *strict* is `True`, the first error encountered when evaluating the path is
    re-raised.
    In particular, [`FileNotFoundError`](exceptions.md#FileNotFoundError "FileNotFoundError") is raised if *path* does not exist,
    or another [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError "OSError") if it is otherwise inaccessible.

    If *strict* is [`os.path.ALLOW_MISSING`](os.path.md#os.path.ALLOW_MISSING "os.path.ALLOW_MISSING"), errors other than
    [`FileNotFoundError`](exceptions.md#FileNotFoundError "FileNotFoundError") are re-raised (as with `strict=True`).
    Thus, the returned path will not contain any symbolic links, but the named
    file and some of its parent directories may be missing.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > This function emulates the operating system’s procedure for making a path
    > canonical, which differs slightly between Windows and UNIX with respect
    > to how links and subsequent path components interact.
    >
    > Operating system APIs make paths canonical as needed, so it’s not
    > normally necessary to call this function.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

    Changed in version 3.8: Symbolic links and junctions are now resolved on Windows.

    Changed in version 3.10: The *strict* parameter was added.

    Changed in version 3.12.11: The [`ALLOW_MISSING`](os.path.md#os.path.ALLOW_MISSING "os.path.ALLOW_MISSING") value for the *strict* parameter
    was added.

`os.path.ALLOW_MISSING`
:   Special value used for the *strict* argument in [`realpath()`](os.path.md#os.path.realpath "os.path.realpath").

    Added in version 3.12.11.

`os.path.relpath(path, start=os.curdir)`
:   Return a relative filepath to *path* either from the current directory or
    from an optional *start* directory. This is a path computation: the
    filesystem is not accessed to confirm the existence or nature of *path* or
    *start*. On Windows, [`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError "ValueError") is raised when *path* and *start*
    are on different drives.

    *start* defaults to [`os.curdir`](os.md#os.curdir "os.curdir").

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.samefile(path1, path2)`
:   Return `True` if both pathname arguments refer to the same file or directory.
    This is determined by the device number and i-node number and raises an
    exception if an [`os.stat()`](os.md#os.stat "os.stat") call on either pathname fails.

    Changed in version 3.2: Added Windows support.

    Changed in version 3.4: Windows now uses the same implementation as all other platforms.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.sameopenfile(fp1, fp2)`
:   Return `True` if the file descriptors *fp1* and *fp2* refer to the same file.

    Changed in version 3.2: Added Windows support.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.samestat(stat1, stat2)`
:   Return `True` if the stat tuples *stat1* and *stat2* refer to the same file.
    These structures may have been returned by [`os.fstat()`](os.md#os.fstat "os.fstat"),
    [`os.lstat()`](os.md#os.lstat "os.lstat"), or [`os.stat()`](os.md#os.stat "os.stat"). This function implements the
    underlying comparison used by [`samefile()`](os.path.md#os.path.samefile "os.path.samefile") and [`sameopenfile()`](os.path.md#os.path.sameopenfile "os.path.sameopenfile").

    Changed in version 3.4: Added Windows support.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.split(path)`
:   Split the pathname *path* into a pair, `(head, tail)` where *tail* is the
    last pathname component and *head* is everything leading up to that. The
    *tail* part will never contain a slash; if *path* ends in a slash, *tail*
    will be empty. If there is no slash in *path*, *head* will be empty. If
    *path* is empty, both *head* and *tail* are empty. Trailing slashes are
    stripped from *head* unless it is the root (one or more slashes only). In
    all cases, `join(head, tail)` returns a path to the same location as *path*
    (but the strings may differ). Also see the functions [`dirname()`](os.path.md#os.path.dirname "os.path.dirname") and
    [`basename()`](os.path.md#os.path.basename "os.path.basename").

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.splitdrive(path)`
:   Split the pathname *path* into a pair `(drive, tail)` where *drive* is either
    a mount point or the empty string. On systems which do not use drive
    specifications, *drive* will always be the empty string. In all cases, `drive
    + tail` will be the same as *path*.

    On Windows, splits a pathname into drive/UNC sharepoint and relative path.

    If the path contains a drive letter, drive will contain everything
    up to and including the colon:

    ```python3
    >>> splitdrive("c:/dir")
    ("c:", "/dir")
    ```

    If the path contains a UNC path, drive will contain the host name
    and share:

    ```python3
    >>> splitdrive("//host/computer/dir")
    ("//host/computer", "/dir")
    ```

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`os.path.splitroot(path)`
:   Split the pathname *path* into a 3-item tuple `(drive, root, tail)` where
    *drive* is a device name or mount point, *root* is a string of separators
    after the drive, and *tail* is everything after the root. Any of these
    items may be the empty string. In all cases, `drive + root + tail` will
    be the same as *path*.

    On POSIX systems, *drive* is always empty. The *root* may be empty (if *path* is
    relative), a single forward slash (if *path* is absolute), or two forward slashes
    (implementation-defined per [IEEE Std 1003.1-2017; 4.13 Pathname Resolution](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_13).)
    For example:

    ```python3
    >>> splitroot('/home/sam')
    ('', '/', 'home/sam')
    >>> splitroot('//home/sam')
    ('', '//', 'home/sam')
    >>> splitroot('///home/sam')
    ('', '/', '//home/sam')
    ```

    On Windows, *drive* may be empty, a drive-letter name, a UNC share, or a device
    name. The *root* may be empty, a forward slash, or a backward slash. For
    example:

    ```python3
    >>> splitroot('C:/Users/Sam')
    ('C:', '/', 'Users/Sam')
    >>> splitroot('//Server/Share/Users/Sam')
    ('//Server/Share', '/', 'Users/Sam')
    ```

    Added in version 3.12.

`os.path.splitext(path)`
:   Split the pathname *path* into a pair `(root, ext)` such that `root + ext ==
    path`, and the extension, *ext*, is empty or begins with a period and contains at
    most one period.

    If the path contains no extension, *ext* will be `''`:

    ```python3
    >>> splitext('bar')
    ('bar', '')
    ```

    If the path contains an extension, then *ext* will be set to this extension,
    including the leading period. Note that previous periods will be ignored:

    ```python3
    >>> splitext('foo.bar.exe')
    ('foo.bar', '.exe')
    >>> splitext('/foo/bar.exe')
    ('/foo/bar', '.exe')
    ```

    Leading periods of the last component of the path are considered to
    be part of the root:

    ```python3
    >>> splitext('.cshrc')
