# `gzip` — Support for **gzip** files

**Source code:** [Lib/gzip.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/gzip.py)

---

This module provides a simple interface to compress and decompress files just
like the GNU programs **gzip** and **gunzip** would.

The data compression is provided by the [`zlib`](zlib.md#module-zlib "zlib: Low-level interface to compression and decompression routines compatible with gzip.") module.

The [`gzip`](gzip.md#module-gzip "gzip: Interfaces for gzip compression and decompression using file objects.") module provides the [`GzipFile`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile") class, as well as the
[`open()`](gzip.md#gzip.open "gzip.open"), [`compress()`](gzip.md#gzip.compress "gzip.compress") and [`decompress()`](gzip.md#gzip.decompress "gzip.decompress") convenience functions.
The [`GzipFile`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile") class reads and writes **gzip**-format files,
automatically compressing or decompressing the data so that it looks like an
ordinary [file object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-file-object).

Note that additional file formats which can be decompressed by the
**gzip** and **gunzip** programs, such as those produced by
**compress** and **pack**, are not supported by this module.

The module defines the following items:

`gzip.open(filename, mode='rb', compresslevel=9, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None)`
:   Open a gzip-compressed file in binary or text mode, returning a [file
    object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-file-object).

    The *filename* argument can be an actual filename (a [`str`](stdtypes.md#str "str") or
    [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes "bytes") object), or an existing file object to read from or write to.

    The *mode* argument can be any of `'r'`, `'rb'`, `'a'`, `'ab'`,
    `'w'`, `'wb'`, `'x'` or `'xb'` for binary mode, or `'rt'`,
    `'at'`, `'wt'`, or `'xt'` for text mode. The default is `'rb'`.

    The *compresslevel* argument is an integer from 0 to 9, as for the
    [`GzipFile`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile") constructor.

    For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the [`GzipFile`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile")
    constructor: `GzipFile(filename, mode, compresslevel)`. In this case, the
    *encoding*, *errors* and *newline* arguments must not be provided.

    For text mode, a [`GzipFile`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile") object is created, and wrapped in an
    [`io.TextIOWrapper`](io.md#io.TextIOWrapper "io.TextIOWrapper") instance with the specified encoding, error
    handling behavior, and line ending(s).

    Changed in version 3.3: Added support for *filename* being a file object, support for text mode,
    and the *encoding*, *errors* and *newline* arguments.

    Changed in version 3.4: Added support for the `'x'`, `'xb'` and `'xt'` modes.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

`exception gzip.BadGzipFile`
:   An exception raised for invalid gzip files. It inherits from [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError "OSError").
    [`EOFError`](exceptions.md#EOFError "EOFError") and [`zlib.error`](zlib.md#zlib.error "zlib.error") can also be raised for invalid gzip
    files.

    Added in version 3.8.

`class gzip.GzipFile(filename=None, mode=None, compresslevel=9, fileobj=None, mtime=None)`
:   Constructor for the [`GzipFile`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile") class, which simulates most of the
    methods of a [file object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-file-object), with the exception of the [`truncate()`](io.md#io.IOBase.truncate "io.IOBase.truncate")
    method. At least one of *fileobj* and *filename* must be given a non-trivial
    value.

    The new class instance is based on *fileobj*, which can be a regular file, an
    [`io.BytesIO`](io.md#io.BytesIO "io.BytesIO") object, or any other object which simulates a file. It
    defaults to `None`, in which case *filename* is opened to provide a file
    object.

    When *fileobj* is not `None`, the *filename* argument is only used to be
    included in the **gzip** file header, which may include the original
    filename of the uncompressed file. It defaults to the filename of *fileobj*, if
    discernible; otherwise, it defaults to the empty string, and in this case the
    original filename is not included in the header.

    The *mode* argument can be any of `'r'`, `'rb'`, `'a'`, `'ab'`, `'w'`,
    `'wb'`, `'x'`, or `'xb'`, depending on whether the file will be read or
    written. The default is the mode of *fileobj* if discernible; otherwise, the
    default is `'rb'`. In future Python releases the mode of *fileobj* will
    not be used. It is better to always specify *mode* for writing.

    Note that the file is always opened in binary mode. To open a compressed file
    in text mode, use [`open()`](gzip.md#gzip.open "gzip.open") (or wrap your [`GzipFile`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile") with an
    [`io.TextIOWrapper`](io.md#io.TextIOWrapper "io.TextIOWrapper")).

    The *compresslevel* argument is an integer from `0` to `9` controlling
    the level of compression; `1` is fastest and produces the least
    compression, and `9` is slowest and produces the most compression. `0`
    is no compression. The default is `9`.

    The *mtime* argument is an optional numeric timestamp to be written to
    the last modification time field in the stream when compressing. It
    should only be provided in compression mode. If omitted or `None`, the
    current time is used. See the [`mtime`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile.mtime "gzip.GzipFile.mtime") attribute for more details.

    Calling a [`GzipFile`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile") object’s `close()` method does not close
    *fileobj*, since you might wish to append more material after the compressed
    data. This also allows you to pass an [`io.BytesIO`](io.md#io.BytesIO "io.BytesIO") object opened for
    writing as *fileobj*, and retrieve the resulting memory buffer using the
    [`io.BytesIO`](io.md#io.BytesIO "io.BytesIO") object’s [`getvalue()`](io.md#io.BytesIO.getvalue "io.BytesIO.getvalue") method.

    [`GzipFile`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile") supports the [`io.BufferedIOBase`](io.md#io.BufferedIOBase "io.BufferedIOBase") interface,
    including iteration and the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement. Only the
    [`truncate()`](io.md#io.IOBase.truncate "io.IOBase.truncate") method isn’t implemented.

    [`GzipFile`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile") also provides the following method and attribute:

    `peek(n)`
    :   Read *n* uncompressed bytes without advancing the file position.
        At most one single read on the compressed stream is done to satisfy
        the call. The number of bytes returned may be more or less than
        requested.

        > **Note:**
        >
        > While calling [`peek()`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile.peek "gzip.GzipFile.peek") does not change the file position of
        > the [`GzipFile`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile"), it may change the position of the underlying
        > file object (e.g. if the [`GzipFile`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile") was constructed with the
        > *fileobj* parameter).

        Added in version 3.2.

    `mtime`
    :   When decompressing, the value of the last modification time field in
        the most recently read header may be read from this attribute, as an
        integer. The initial value before reading any headers is `None`.

        All **gzip** compressed streams are required to contain this
        timestamp field. Some programs, such as **gunzip**, make use
        of the timestamp. The format is the same as the return value of
        [`time.time()`](time.md#time.time "time.time") and the [`st_mtime`](os.md#os.stat_result.st_mtime "os.stat_result.st_mtime") attribute of
        the object returned by [`os.stat()`](os.md#os.stat "os.stat").

    `name`
    :   The path to the gzip file on disk, as a [`str`](stdtypes.md#str "str") or [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes "bytes").
        Equivalent to the output of [`os.fspath()`](os.md#os.fspath "os.fspath") on the original input path,
        with no other normalization, resolution or expansion.

    Changed in version 3.1: Support for the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement was added, along with the
    *mtime* constructor argument and [`mtime`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile.mtime "gzip.GzipFile.mtime") attribute.

    Changed in version 3.2: Support for zero-padded and unseekable files was added.

    Changed in version 3.3: The [`io.BufferedIOBase.read1()`](io.md#io.BufferedIOBase.read1 "io.BufferedIOBase.read1") method is now implemented.

    Changed in version 3.4: Added support for the `'x'` and `'xb'` modes.

    Changed in version 3.5: Added support for writing arbitrary
    [bytes-like objects](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object).
    The [`read()`](io.md#io.BufferedIOBase.read "io.BufferedIOBase.read") method now accepts an argument of
    `None`.

    Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a [path-like object](https://docs.python.org/3.12/glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

    Changed in version 3.12: Remove the `filename` attribute, use the [`name`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile.name "gzip.GzipFile.name")
    attribute instead.

    Deprecated since version 3.9: Opening [`GzipFile`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile") for writing without specifying the *mode*
    argument is deprecated.

`gzip.compress(data, compresslevel=9, *, mtime=None)`
:   Compress the *data*, returning a [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes "bytes") object containing
    the compressed data. *compresslevel* and *mtime* have the same meaning as in
    the [`GzipFile`](gzip.md#gzip.GzipFile "gzip.GzipFile") constructor above. When *mtime* is set to `0`, this
    function is equivalent to [`zlib.compress()`](zlib.md#zlib.compress "zlib.compress") with *wbits* set to `31`.
    The zlib function is faster.

    Added in version 3.2.

    Changed in version 3.8: Added the *mtime* parameter for reproducible output.

    Changed in version 3.11: Speed is improved by compressing all data at once instead of in a
    streamed fashion. Calls with *mtime* set to `0` are delegated to
    [`zlib.compress()`](zlib.md#zlib.compress "zlib.compress") for better speed. In this situation the
    output may contain a gzip header “OS” byte value other than 255
    “unknown” as supplied by the underlying zlib implementation.

`gzip.decompress(data)`
:   Decompress the *data*, returning a [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes "bytes") object containing the
    uncompressed data. This function is capable of decompressing multi-member
    gzip data (multiple gzip blocks concatenated together). When the data is
    certain to contain only one member the [`zlib.decompress()`](zlib.md#zlib.decompress "zlib.decompress") function with
    *wbits* set to 31 is faster.

    Added in version 3.2.

    Changed in version 3.11: Speed is improved by decompressing members at once in memory instead of in
    a streamed fashion.

## Examples of usage

Example of how to read a compressed file:

```python3
import gzip
with gzip.open('/home/joe/file.txt.gz', 'rb') as f:
    file_content = f.read()
```

Example of how to create a compressed GZIP file:

```python3
import gzip
content = b"Lots of content here"
with gzip.open('/home/joe/file.txt.gz', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(content)
```

Example of how to GZIP compress an existing file:

```python3
import gzip
import shutil
with open('/home/joe/file.txt', 'rb') as f_in:
    with gzip.open('/home/joe/file.txt.gz', 'wb') as f_out:
        shutil.copyfileobj(f_in, f_out)
```

Example of how to GZIP compress a binary string:

```python3
import gzip
s_in = b"Lots of content here"
s_out = gzip.compress(s_in)
```

## Command Line Interface

The [`gzip`](gzip.md#module-gzip "gzip: Interfaces for gzip compression and decompression using file objects.") module provides a simple command line interface to compress or
decompress files.

Once executed the [`gzip`](gzip.md#module-gzip "gzip: Interfaces for gzip compression and decompression using file objects.") module keeps the input file(s).

Changed in version 3.8: Add a new command line interface with a usage.
By default, when you will execute the CLI, the default compression level is 6.

### Command line options

`file`
:   If *file* is not specified, read from [`sys.stdin`](sys.md#sys.stdin "sys.stdin").

`--fast`

`--best`
:   Indicates the slowest compression method (best compression).

`-d, --decompress`
