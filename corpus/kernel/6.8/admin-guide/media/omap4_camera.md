# 7.13. OMAP4 ISS Driver

## 7.13.1. Introduction

The OMAP44XX family of chips contains the Imaging SubSystem (a.k.a. ISS),
Which contains several components that can be categorized in 3 big groups:

- Interfaces (2 Interfaces: CSI2-A & CSI2-B/CCP2)
- ISP (Image Signal Processor)
- SIMCOP (Still Image Coprocessor)

For more information, please look in [1](omap4_camera.md#f1) for latest version of:
"OMAP4430 Multimedia Device Silicon Revision 2.x"

As of Revision AB, the ISS is described in detail in section 8.

This driver is supporting **only** the CSI2-A/B interfaces for now.

It makes use of the Media Controller framework [2](omap4_camera.md#f2), and inherited most of the
code from OMAP3 ISP driver (found under drivers/media/platform/ti/omap3isp/\*),
except that it doesn't need an IOMMU now for ISS buffers memory mapping.

Supports usage of MMAP buffers only (for now).

## 7.13.2. Tested platforms

- OMAP4430SDP, w/ ES2.1 GP & SEVM4430-CAM-V1-0 (Contains IMX060 & OV5640, in
  which only the last one is supported, outputting YUV422 frames).
- TI Blaze MDP, w/ OMAP4430 ES2.2 EMU (Contains 1 IMX060 & 2 OV5650 sensors, in
  which only the OV5650 are supported, outputting RAW10 frames).
- PandaBoard, Rev. A2, w/ OMAP4430 ES2.1 GP & OV adapter board, tested with
  following sensors:
  \* OV5640
  \* OV5650
- Tested on mainline kernel:
