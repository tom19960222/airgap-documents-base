# 3.1. Demux Data Types

enum dmx_output
:   Output for the demux.

**Constants**

`DMX_OUT_DECODER`

> Streaming directly to decoder.

`DMX_OUT_TAP`

> is called.

`DMX_OUT_TS_TAP`

> Output multiplexed into a new TS (to be retrieved by reading from the
> logical DVR device). Routes output to the logical DVR device
> `/dev/dvb/adapter?/dvr?`, which delivers a TS multiplexed from all
> filters for which **DMX_OUT_TS_TAP** was specified.

`filter`
:   bit array with bits to be matched at the section header.

`mask`
:   bits that are valid at the filter bit array.

`mode`
:   mode of match: if bit is zero, it will match if equal (positive
    match); if bit is one, it will match if the bit is negated.

**Note**

All arrays in this struct have a size of DMX_FILTER_SIZE (16 bytes).

struct dmx_sct_filter_params

> - `DMX_ONESHOT` - disable the section filter after one section
>   has been delivered;
> - `DMX_IMMEDIATE_START` - Start filter immediately without requiring a
>   [DMX_START](dmx-start.md#dmx-start).

    __u32 length;
    __u32 flags;
    __u32 count;
};
```

**Members**

`index`
:   id number of the buffer

`bytesused`
:   number of bytes occupied by data in the buffer (payload);

`offset`
:   for buffers with memory == DMX_MEMORY_MMAP;
    offset from the start of the device memory for this plane,
    (or a "cookie" that should be passed to mmap() as offset)

`length`
:   size in bytes of the buffer

`flags`
:   bit array of buffer flags as defined by [`enum dmx_buffer_flags`](dmx_types.md#c.dmx_buffer_flags "dmx_buffer_flags").
    Filled only at `DMX_DQBUF`.

`count`
:   monotonic counter for filled buffers. Helps to identify
    data stream loses. Filled only at `DMX_DQBUF`.

**Description**

Contains data exchanged by application and driver using one of the streaming
I/O methods.

Please notice that, for `DMX_QBUF`, only **index** should be filled.
On `DMX_DQBUF` calls, all fields will be filled by the Kernel.

struct dmx_requestbuffers
:   request dmx buffer information

**Definition**:

```
struct dmx_requestbuffers {
    __u32 count;
    __u32 size;
};
```

**Members**

`count`
:   number of requested buffers,

`size`
:   size in bytes of the requested buffer

**Description**

Contains data used for requesting a dmx buffer.
All reserved fields must be set to zero.

struct dmx_exportbuffer
:   export of dmx buffer as DMABUF file descriptor

**Definition**:

```
struct dmx_exportbuffer {
    __u32 index;
    __u32 flags;
    __s32 fd;
};
```

**Members**

`index`
:   id number of the buffer

`flags`
:   flags for newly created file, currently only O_CLOEXEC is
    supported, refer to manual of open syscall for more details

`fd`
:   file descriptor associated with DMABUF (set by driver)

**Description**

Contains data used for exporting a dmx buffer as DMABUF file descriptor.
The buffer is identified by a 'cookie' returned by DMX_QUERYBUF
(identical to the cookie used to mmap() the buffer to userspace). All
reserved fields must be set to zero. The field reserved0 is expected to
become a structure 'type' allowing an alternative layout of the structure
content. Therefore this field should not be used for any other extensions.
