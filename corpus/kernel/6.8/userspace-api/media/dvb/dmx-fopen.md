# 3.2.1. Digital TV demux open()

## 3.2.1.1. Name

Digital TV demux [`open()`](dmx-fopen.md#c.DTV.dmx.open "DTV.dmx.open")

## 3.2.1.2. Synopsis

int open(const char \*deviceName, int flags)

## 3.2.1.3. Arguments

`name`
:   Name of specific Digital TV demux device.

`flags`
:   A bit-wise OR of the following flags:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `O_RDONLY` | read-only access |
| `O_RDWR` | read/write access |
| `O_NONBLOCK` | open in non-blocking mode (blocking mode is the default) |

## 3.2.1.4. Description

This system call, used with a device name of `/dev/dvb/adapter?/demux?`,
allocates a new filter and returns a handle which can be used for
subsequent control of that filter. This call has to be made for each
filter to be used, i.e. every returned file descriptor is a reference to
a single filter. `/dev/dvb/adapter?/dvr?` is a logical device to be used
for retrieving Transport Streams for digital video recording. When
reading from this device a transport stream containing the packets from
all PES filters set in the corresponding demux device
(`/dev/dvb/adapter?/demux?`) having the output set to `DMX_OUT_TS_TAP`.
A recorded Transport Stream is replayed by writing to this device.

The significance of blocking or non-blocking mode is described in the
documentation for functions where there is a difference. It does not
affect the semantics of the `open()` call itself. A device opened
in blocking mode can later be put into non-blocking mode (and vice versa)
using the `F_SETFL` command of the fcntl system call.

## 3.2.1.5. Return Value

On success 0 is returned.

On error -1 is returned, and the `errno` variable is set
appropriately.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `EMFILE` | "Too many open files", i.e. no more filters available. |

The generic error codes are described at the
[Generic Error Codes](../gen-errors.md#id1) chapter.
