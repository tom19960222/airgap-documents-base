# 2. Digital TV Frontend API

The Digital TV frontend API was designed to support three groups of delivery
systems: Terrestrial, cable and Satellite. Currently, the following
delivery systems are supported:

- Terrestrial systems: DVB-T, DVB-T2, ATSC, ATSC M/H, ISDB-T, DVB-H,
  DTMB, CMMB
- Cable systems: DVB-C Annex A/C, ClearQAM (DVB-C Annex B)
- Satellite systems: DVB-S, DVB-S2, DVB Turbo, ISDB-S, DSS

The Digital TV frontend controls several sub-devices including:

- Tuner
- Digital TV demodulator
- Low noise amplifier (LNA)
- Satellite Equipment Control (SEC) [1](frontend.md#f1).

The frontend can be accessed through `/dev/dvb/adapter?/frontend?`.
Data types and ioctl definitions can be accessed by including
`linux/dvb/frontend.h` in your application.

> **Note:**
>
> Transmission via the internet (DVB-IP) and MMT (MPEG Media Transport)
> is not yet handled by this API but a future extension is possible.

:   On Satellite systems, the API support for the Satellite Equipment
    Control (SEC) allows to power control and to send/receive signals to
    control the antenna subsystem, selecting the polarization and choosing
    the Intermediate Frequency IF) of the Low Noise Block Converter Feed
    Horn (LNBf). It supports the DiSEqC and V-SEC protocols. The DiSEqC
    (digital SEC) specification is available at
    [Eutelsat](http://www.eutelsat.com/satellites/4_5_5.html).
