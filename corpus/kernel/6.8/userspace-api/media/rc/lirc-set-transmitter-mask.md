# 6.5.13. ioctl LIRC_SET_TRANSMITTER_MASK

## 6.5.13.1. Name

LIRC_SET_TRANSMITTER_MASK - Enables send codes on a given set of transmitters

## 6.5.13.2. Synopsis

LIRC_SET_TRANSMITTER_MASK

`int ioctl(int fd, LIRC_SET_TRANSMITTER_MASK, __u32 *mask)`

## 6.5.13.3. Arguments

`fd`
:   File descriptor returned by open().

`mask`
:   Mask with channels to enable tx. Channel 0 is the least significant bit.

## 6.5.13.4. Description

Some IR TX devices have multiple output channels, in such case,
[LIRC_CAN_SET_TRANSMITTER_MASK](lirc-get-features.md#lirc-can-set-transmitter-mask) is
returned via [ioctl LIRC_GET_FEATURES](lirc-get-features.md#lirc-get-features) and this ioctl sets what channels will
send IR codes.

This ioctl enables the given set of transmitters. The first transmitter is
encoded by the least significant bit and so on.

When an invalid bit mask is given, i.e. a bit is set, even though the device
does not have so many transitters, then this ioctl returns the number of
available transitters and does nothing otherwise.

## 6.5.13.5. Return Value

On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the `errno` variable is set
appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
[Generic Error Codes](../gen-errors.md#id1) chapter.
