# 2.8.1. Packed HSV formats

## 2.8.1.1. Description

The *hue* (h) is measured in degrees, the equivalence between degrees and LSBs
depends on the hsv-encoding used, see [Colorspaces](colorspaces.md#colorspaces).
The *saturation* (s) and the *value* (v) are measured in percentage of the
cylinder: 0 being the smallest value and 255 the maximum.

The values are packed in 24 or 32 bit formats.
