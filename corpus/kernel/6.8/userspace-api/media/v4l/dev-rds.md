# 4.9. RDS Interface

The Radio Data System transmits supplementary information in binary
format, for example the station name or travel information, on an
inaudible audio subcarrier of a radio program. This interface is aimed
at devices capable of receiving and/or transmitting RDS information.

For more information see the core RDS standard [IEC 62106](biblio.md#iec62106) and the
RBDS standard [NRSC-4-B](biblio.md#nrsc4).

> **Note:**
>
> Note that the RBDS standard as is used in the USA is almost
> identical to the RDS standard. Any RDS decoder/encoder can also handle
> RBDS. Only some of the fields have slightly different meanings. See the
> RBDS standard for more information.

The RBDS standard also specifies support for MMBS (Modified Mobile
Search). This is a proprietary format which seems to be discontinued.
The RDS interface does not support this format. Should support for MMBS
(or the so-called 'E blocks' in general) be needed, then please contact
the linux-media mailing list:
<https://linuxtv.org/lists.php>.

## 4.9.1. Querying Capabilities

Devices supporting the RDS capturing API set the
`V4L2_CAP_RDS_CAPTURE` flag in the `capabilities` field of struct
[`v4l2_capability`](vidioc-querycap.md#c.V4L.v4l2_capability "v4l2_capability") returned by the
[ioctl VIDIOC_QUERYCAP](vidioc-querycap.md#vidioc-querycap) ioctl. Any tuner that
supports RDS will set the `V4L2_TUNER_CAP_RDS` flag in the
`capability` field of struct [`v4l2_tuner`](vidioc-g-tuner.md#c.V4L.v4l2_tuner "v4l2_tuner"). If the
driver only passes RDS blocks without interpreting the data the
`V4L2_TUNER_CAP_RDS_BLOCK_IO` flag has to be set, see
[Reading RDS data](dev-rds.md#reading-rds-data). For future use the flag
`V4L2_TUNER_CAP_RDS_CONTROLS` has also been defined. However, a driver
for a radio tuner with this capability does not yet exist, so if you are
planning to write such a driver you should discuss this on the
linux-media mailing list:
<https://linuxtv.org/lists.php>.

Whether an RDS signal is present can be detected by looking at the
`rxsubchans` field of struct [`v4l2_tuner`](vidioc-g-tuner.md#c.V4L.v4l2_tuner "v4l2_tuner"): the
`V4L2_TUNER_SUB_RDS` will be set if RDS data was detected.

Devices supporting the RDS output API set the `V4L2_CAP_RDS_OUTPUT`
flag in the `capabilities` field of struct
[`v4l2_capability`](vidioc-querycap.md#c.V4L.v4l2_capability "v4l2_capability") returned by the
[ioctl VIDIOC_QUERYCAP](vidioc-querycap.md#vidioc-querycap) ioctl. Any modulator that
supports RDS will set the `V4L2_TUNER_CAP_RDS` flag in the
`capability` field of struct
[`v4l2_modulator`](vidioc-g-modulator.md#c.V4L.v4l2_modulator "v4l2_modulator"). In order to enable the RDS
transmission one must set the `V4L2_TUNER_SUB_RDS` bit in the
`txsubchans` field of struct
[`v4l2_modulator`](vidioc-g-modulator.md#c.V4L.v4l2_modulator "v4l2_modulator"). If the driver only passes RDS
blocks without interpreting the data the `V4L2_TUNER_CAP_RDS_BLOCK_IO`
flag has to be set. If the tuner is capable of handling RDS entities
like program identification codes and radio text, the flag
`V4L2_TUNER_CAP_RDS_CONTROLS` should be set, see
[Writing RDS data](dev-rds.md#writing-rds-data) and
[FM Transmitter Control Reference](ext-ctrls-fm-tx.md#fm-tx-controls).

## 4.9.2. Reading RDS data

RDS data can be read from the radio device with the
[`read()`](func-read.md#c.V4L.read "read") function. The data is packed in groups of
three bytes.

## 4.9.3. Writing RDS data

RDS data can be written to the radio device with the
[`write()`](func-write.md#c.V4L.write "write") function. The data is packed in groups of
three bytes, as follows:
