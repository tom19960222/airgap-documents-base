# 7.16. ioctl VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMEINTERVALS

## 7.16.1. Name

VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMEINTERVALS - Enumerate frame intervals

## 7.16.2. Synopsis

VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMEINTERVALS

`int ioctl(int fd, VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMEINTERVALS, struct v4l2_frmivalenum *argp)`

## 7.16.3. Arguments

`fd`
:   File descriptor returned by [`open()`](func-open.md#c.V4L.open "open").

`argp`
:   Pointer to struct [`v4l2_frmivalenum`](vidioc-enum-frameintervals.md#c.V4L.v4l2_frmivalenum "v4l2_frmivalenum")
    that contains a pixel format and size and receives a frame interval.

## 7.16.4. Description

This ioctl allows applications to enumerate all frame intervals that the
device supports for the given pixel format and frame size.

The supported pixel formats and frame sizes can be obtained by using the
[ioctl VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT](vidioc-enum-fmt.md#vidioc-enum-fmt) and
[ioctl VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES](vidioc-enum-framesizes.md#vidioc-enum-framesizes) functions.

The return value and the content of the `v4l2_frmivalenum.type` field
depend on the type of frame intervals the device supports. Here are the
semantics of the function for the different cases:

- **Discrete:** The function returns success if the given index value
  (zero-based) is valid. The application should increase the index by
  one for each call until `EINVAL` is returned. The
  v4l2_frmivalenum.type field is set to
  V4L2_FRMIVAL_TYPE_DISCRETE by the driver. Of the union only
  the discrete member is valid.
- **Step-wise:** The function returns success if the given index value
  is zero and `EINVAL` for any other index value. The
  `v4l2_frmivalenum.type` field is set to
  `V4L2_FRMIVAL_TYPE_STEPWISE` by the driver. Of the union only the
  `stepwise` member is valid.
- **Continuous:** This is a special case of the step-wise type above.
  The function returns success if the given index value is zero and
  `EINVAL` for any other index value. The `v4l2_frmivalenum.type`
  field is set to `V4L2_FRMIVAL_TYPE_CONTINUOUS` by the driver. Of
  the union only the `stepwise` member is valid and the `step`
  value is set to 1.

When the application calls the function with index zero, it must check
the `type` field to determine the type of frame interval enumeration
the device supports. Only for the `V4L2_FRMIVAL_TYPE_DISCRETE` type
does it make sense to increase the index value to receive more frame
intervals.

> **Note:**
>
> The order in which the frame intervals are returned has no
> special meaning. In particular does it not say anything about potential
> default frame intervals.

Applications can assume that the enumeration data does not change
without any interaction from the application itself. This means that the
enumeration data is consistent if the application does not perform any
other ioctl calls while it runs the frame interval enumeration.

> **Note:**
>
> **Frame intervals and frame rates:** The V4L2 API uses frame
> intervals instead of frame rates. Given the frame interval the frame
> rate can be computed as follows:
>
> ```
> frame_rate = 1 / frame_interval
> ```

## 7.16.5. Structs

In the structs below, *IN* denotes a value that has to be filled in by
the application, *OUT* denotes values that the driver fills in. The
application should zero out all members except for the *IN* fields.

## 7.16.6. Enums

type v4l2_frmivaltypes

enum v4l2_frmivaltypes

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `V4L2_FRMIVAL_TYPE_DISCRETE` | 1 | Discrete frame interval. |

appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
[Generic Error Codes](../gen-errors.md#id1) chapter.
