## 2.6.1.9.1. 14-bit Bayer formats expanded to 16 bits

### 2.6.1.9.1.1. Description

These four pixel formats are raw sRGB / Bayer formats with 14 bits per
colour. Each sample is stored in a 16-bit word, with two unused high
bits filled with zeros. Each n-pixel row contains n/2 green samples
and n/2 blue or red samples, with alternating red and blue rows. Bytes
are stored in memory in little endian order. They are conventionally
described as GRGR... BGBG..., RGRG... GBGB..., etc. Below is an
example of a small V4L2_PIX_FMT_SBGGR14 image:

**Byte Order.**
Each cell is one byte, the two most significant bits in the high bytes are
zero.
