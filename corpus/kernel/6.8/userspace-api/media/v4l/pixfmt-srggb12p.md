## 2.6.1.8.1. 12-bit packed Bayer formats

### 2.6.1.8.1.1. Description

These four pixel formats are packed raw sRGB / Bayer formats with 12
bits per colour. Every two consecutive samples are packed into three
bytes. Each of the first two bytes contain the 8 high order bits of
the pixels, and the third byte contains the four least significants
bits of each pixel, in the same order.

Each n-pixel row contains n/2 green samples and n/2 blue or red
samples, with alternating green-red and green-blue rows. They are
conventionally described as GRGR... BGBG..., RGRG... GBGB..., etc.
Below is an example of a small V4L2_PIX_FMT_SBGGR12P image:

**Byte Order.**
Each cell is one byte.
