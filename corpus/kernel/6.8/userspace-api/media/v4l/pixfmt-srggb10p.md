10-bit packed Bayer formats

## 2.6.1.3.1. Description

These four pixel formats are packed raw sRGB / Bayer formats with 10
bits per sample. Every four consecutive samples are packed into 5
bytes. Each of the first 4 bytes contain the 8 high order bits
of the pixels, and the 5th byte contains the 2 least significants
bits of each pixel, in the same order.

Each n-pixel row contains n/2 green samples and n/2 blue or red samples,
with alternating green-red and green-blue rows. They are conventionally
described as GRGR... BGBG..., RGRG... GBGB..., etc. Below is an example
of a small V4L2_PIX_FMT_SBGGR10P image:

**Byte Order.**
Each cell is one byte.
