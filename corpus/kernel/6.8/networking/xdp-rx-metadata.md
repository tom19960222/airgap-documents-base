# XDP RX Metadata

This document describes how an eXpress Data Path (XDP) program can access
hardware metadata related to a packet using a set of helper functions,
and how it can pass that metadata on to other consumers.

## General Design

XDP has access to a set of kfuncs to manipulate the metadata in an XDP frame.
Every device driver that wishes to expose additional packet metadata can
implement these kfuncs. The set of kfuncs is declared in `include/net/xdp.h`
via `XDP_METADATA_KFUNC_xxx`.

Currently, the following kfuncs are supported. In the future, as more
metadata is supported, this set will grow:

__bpf_kfunc int bpf_xdp_metadata_rx_timestamp(const struct xdp_md \*ctx, u64 \*timestamp)
:   Read XDP frame RX timestamp.

**Parameters**

`const struct xdp_md *ctx`
:   XDP context pointer.

`u64 *timestamp`
:   Return value pointer.

**Return**

- Returns 0 on success or `-errno` on error.
- `-EOPNOTSUPP` : means device driver does not implement kfunc
- `-ENODATA` : means no RX-timestamp available for this frame

__bpf_kfunc int bpf_xdp_metadata_rx_hash(const struct xdp_md \*ctx, u32 \*hash, enum xdp_rss_hash_type \*rss_type)
:   Read XDP frame RX hash.

**Parameters**

`const struct xdp_md *ctx`
:   XDP context pointer.

`u32 *hash`
:   Return value pointer.

`enum xdp_rss_hash_type *rss_type`
:   Return value pointer for RSS type.

**Description**

The RSS hash type (**rss_type**) specifies what portion of packet headers NIC
hardware used when calculating RSS hash value. The RSS type can be decoded
via `enum xdp_rss_hash_type` either matching on individual L3/L4 bits
`XDP_RSS_L*` or by combined traditional *RSS Hashing Types*
`XDP_RSS_TYPE_L*`.

**Return**

- Returns 0 on success or `-errno` on error.
- `-EOPNOTSUPP` : means device driver doesn't implement kfunc
- `-ENODATA` : means no RX-hash available for this frame

__bpf_kfunc int bpf_xdp_metadata_rx_vlan_tag(const struct xdp_md \*ctx, __be16 \*vlan_proto, u16 \*vlan_tci)
:   Get XDP packet outermost VLAN tag

**Parameters**

`const struct xdp_md *ctx`
:   XDP context pointer.

`__be16 *vlan_proto`
:   Destination pointer for VLAN Tag protocol identifier (TPID).

`u16 *vlan_tci`
:   Destination pointer for VLAN TCI (VID + DEI + PCP)

**Description**

In case of success, `vlan_proto` contains *Tag protocol identifier (TPID)*,
usually `ETH_P_8021Q` or `ETH_P_8021AD`, but some networks can use
custom TPIDs. `vlan_proto` is stored in **network byte order (BE)**
and should be used as follows:
`if (vlan_proto == bpf_htons(ETH_P_8021Q)) do_something();`

`vlan_tci` contains the remaining 16 bits of a VLAN tag.
Driver is expected to provide those in **host byte order (usually LE)**,
so the bpf program should not perform byte conversion.
According to 802.1Q standard, *VLAN TCI (Tag control information)*
is a bit field that contains:
*VLAN identifier (VID)* that can be read with `vlan_tci & 0xfff`,
*Drop eligible indicator (DEI)* - 1 bit,
*Priority code point (PCP)* - 3 bits.
For detailed meaning of DEI and PCP, please refer to other sources.

**Return**

- Returns 0 on success or `-errno` on error.
- `-EOPNOTSUPP` : device driver doesn't implement kfunc
- `-ENODATA` : VLAN tag was not stripped or is not available

An XDP program can use these kfuncs to read the metadata into stack
variables for its own consumption. Or, to pass the metadata on to other
consumers, an XDP program can store it into the metadata area carried
ahead of the packet. Not all packets will necessary have the requested
metadata available in which case the driver returns `-ENODATA`.

Not all kfuncs have to be implemented by the device driver; when not
implemented, the default ones that return `-EOPNOTSUPP` will be used
to indicate the device driver have not implemented this kfunc.

Within an XDP frame, the metadata layout (accessed via `xdp_buff`) is
as follows:

```
+----------+-----------------+------+
| headroom | custom metadata | data |
+----------+-----------------+------+
           ^                 ^
           |                 |
 xdp_buff->data_meta   xdp_buff->data
```

An XDP program can store individual metadata items into this `data_meta`
area in whichever format it chooses. Later consumers of the metadata
will have to agree on the format by some out of band contract (like for
the AF_XDP use case, see below).

## AF_XDP

[AF_XDP](af_xdp.md) use-case implies that there is a contract between the BPF
program that redirects XDP frames into the `AF_XDP` socket (`XSK`) and
the final consumer. Thus the BPF program manually allocates a fixed number of
bytes out of metadata via `bpf_xdp_adjust_meta` and calls a subset
of kfuncs to populate it. The userspace `XSK` consumer computes
`xsk_umem__get_data() - METADATA_SIZE` to locate that metadata.
Note, `xsk_umem__get_data` is defined in `libxdp` and
`METADATA_SIZE` is an application-specific constant (`AF_XDP` receive
descriptor does _not_ explicitly carry the size of the metadata).

Here is the `AF_XDP` consumer layout (note missing `data_meta` pointer):

```
+----------+-----------------+------+
| headroom | custom metadata | data |
+----------+-----------------+------+
                             ^
                             |
                      rx_desc->address
```

## XDP_PASS

This is the path where the packets processed by the XDP program are passed
into the kernel. The kernel creates the `skb` out of the `xdp_buff`
contents. Currently, every driver has custom kernel code to parse
the descriptors and populate `skb` metadata when doing this `xdp_buff->skb`
conversion, and the XDP metadata is not used by the kernel when building
`skbs`. However, TC-BPF programs can access the XDP metadata area using
the `data_meta` pointer.

In the future, we'd like to support a case where an XDP program
can override some of the metadata used for building `skbs`.

## bpf_redirect_map

`bpf_redirect_map` can redirect the frame to a different device.
Some devices (like virtual ethernet links) support running a second XDP
program after the redirect. However, the final consumer doesn't have
access to the original hardware descriptor and can't access any of
the original metadata. The same applies to XDP programs installed
into devmaps and cpumaps.

This means that for redirected packets only custom metadata is
currently supported, which has to be prepared by the initial XDP program
before redirect. If the frame is eventually passed to the kernel, the
`skb` created from such a frame won't have any hardware metadata populated
in its `skb`. If such a packet is later redirected into an `XSK`,
that will also only have access to the custom metadata.

## bpf_tail_call

Adding programs that access metadata kfuncs to the `BPF_MAP_TYPE_PROG_ARRAY`
is currently not supported.

## Supported Devices

It is possible to query which kfunc the particular netdev implements via
netlink. See `xdp-rx-metadata-features` attribute set in
`Documentation/netlink/specs/netdev.yaml`.

## Example

See `tools/testing/selftests/bpf/progs/xdp_metadata.c` and
`tools/testing/selftests/bpf/prog_tests/xdp_metadata.c` for an example of
BPF program that handles XDP metadata.
