# What is aty128fb?

This is a driver for a graphic framebuffer for ATI Rage128 based devices
on Intel and PPC boxes.

Advantages:

> - It provides a nice large console (128 cols + 48 lines with 1024x768)
>   without using tiny, unreadable fonts.
> - You can run XF68_FBDev on top of /dev/fb0
> - Most important: boot logo :-)

Disadvantages:

> - graphic mode is slower than text mode... but you should not notice
>   if you use same resolution as you used in textmode.
> - still experimental.

## How to use it?

Switching modes is done using the video=aty128fb:<resolution>... modedb
boot parameter or using fbset program.

See [modedb default video mode support](modedb.md) for more information on modedb
resolutions.

You should compile in both vgacon (to boot if you remove your Rage128 from
box) and aty128fb (for graphics mode). You should not compile-in vesafb
unless you have primary display on non-Rage128 VBE2.0 device (see
[What is vesafb?](vesafb.md) for details).

## X11

XF68_FBDev should generally work fine, but it is non-accelerated. As of
this document, 8 and 32bpp works fine. There have been palette issues
when switching from X to console and back to X. You will have to restart
X to fix this.

## Configuration

You can pass kernel command line options to vesafb with
video=aty128fb:option1,option2:value2,option3 (multiple options should
be separated by comma, values are separated from options by :).
Accepted options:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| noaccel | do not use acceleration engine. It is default. |
| accel | use acceleration engine. Not finished. |
| vmode:x | chooses PowerMacintosh video mode <x>. Deprecated. |
| cmode:x | chooses PowerMacintosh colour mode <x>. Deprecated. |
| <XxX@X> | selects startup videomode. See [modedb default video mode support](modedb.md) for detailed explanation. Default is 640x480x8bpp. |

## Limitations

There are known and unknown bugs, features and misfeatures.
Currently there are following known bugs:
