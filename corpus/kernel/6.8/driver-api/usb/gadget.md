# USB Gadget API for Linux

Author

## Introduction

This document presents a Linux-USB "Gadget" kernel mode API, for use
within peripherals and other USB devices that embed Linux. It provides
an overview of the API structure, and shows how that fits into a system
development project. This is the first such API released on Linux to
address a number of important problems, including:

- Supports USB 2.0, for high speed devices which can stream data at
  several dozen megabytes per second.
- Handles devices with dozens of endpoints just as well as ones with
  just two fixed-function ones. Gadget drivers can be written so
  they're easy to port to new hardware.
- Flexible enough to expose more complex USB device capabilities such
  as multiple configurations, multiple interfaces, composite devices,
  and alternate interface settings.
- USB "On-The-Go" (OTG) support, in conjunction with updates to the
  Linux-USB host side.
- Sharing data structures and API models with the Linux-USB host side
  API. This helps the OTG support, and looks forward to more-symmetric
  frameworks (where the same I/O model is used by both host and device
  side drivers).
- Minimalist, so it's easier to support new device controller hardware.
  I/O processing doesn't imply large demands for memory or CPU
  resources.

Most Linux developers will not be able to use this API, since they have
USB `host` hardware in a PC, workstation, or server. Linux users with
embedded systems are more likely to have USB peripheral hardware. To
distinguish drivers running inside such hardware from the more familiar
Linux "USB device drivers", which are host side proxies for the real USB
devices, a different term is used: the drivers inside the peripherals
are "USB gadget drivers". In USB protocol interactions, the device
driver is the master (or "client driver") and the gadget driver is the
slave (or "function driver").

The gadget API resembles the host side Linux-USB API in that both use
queues of request objects to package I/O buffers, and those requests may
be submitted or canceled. They share common definitions for the standard
USB *Chapter 9* messages, structures, and constants. Also, both APIs
bind and unbind drivers to devices. The APIs differ in detail, since the
host side's current URB framework exposes a number of implementation
details and assumptions that are inappropriate for a gadget API. While
the model for control transfers and configuration management is
necessarily different (one side is a hardware-neutral master, the other
is a hardware-aware slave), the endpoint I/0 API used here should also
be usable for an overhead-reduced host side API.

## Structure of Gadget Drivers

A system running inside a USB peripheral normally has at least three
layers inside the kernel to handle USB protocol processing, and may have
additional layers in user space code. The `gadget` API is used by the
middle layer to interact with the lowest level (which directly handles
hardware).

In Linux, from the bottom up, these layers are:

*USB Controller Driver*
:   This is the lowest software level. It is the only layer that talks
    to hardware, through registers, fifos, dma, irqs, and the like. The
    `<linux/usb/gadget.h>` API abstracts the peripheral controller
    endpoint hardware. That hardware is exposed through endpoint
    objects, which accept streams of IN/OUT buffers, and through
    callbacks that interact with gadget drivers. Since normal USB
    devices only have one upstream port, they only have one of these
    drivers. The controller driver can support any number of different
    gadget drivers, but only one of them can be used at a time.

    Examples of such controller hardware include the PCI-based NetChip
    2280 USB 2.0 high speed controller, the SA-11x0 or PXA-25x UDC
    (found within many PDAs), and a variety of other products.

*Gadget Driver*
:   The lower boundary of this driver implements hardware-neutral USB
    functions, using calls to the controller driver. Because such
    hardware varies widely in capabilities and restrictions, and is used
    in embedded environments where space is at a premium, the gadget
    driver is often configured at compile time to work with endpoints
    supported by one particular controller. Gadget drivers may be
    portable to several different controllers, using conditional
    compilation. (Recent kernels substantially simplify the work
    involved in supporting new hardware, by *autoconfiguring* endpoints
    automatically for many bulk-oriented drivers.) Gadget driver
    responsibilities include:

    - handling setup requests (ep0 protocol responses) possibly
      including class-specific functionality
    - returning configuration and string descriptors
    - (re)setting configurations and interface altsettings, including
      enabling and configuring endpoints
    - handling life cycle events, such as managing bindings to
      hardware, USB suspend/resume, remote wakeup, and disconnection
      from the USB host.
    - managing IN and OUT transfers on all currently enabled endpoints

    Such drivers may be modules of proprietary code, although that
    approach is discouraged in the Linux community.

*Upper Level*
:   Most gadget drivers have an upper boundary that connects to some
    Linux driver or framework in Linux. Through that boundary flows the
    data which the gadget driver produces and/or consumes through
    protocol transfers over USB. Examples include:

    - user mode code, using generic (gadgetfs) or application specific
      files in `/dev`
    - networking subsystem (for network gadgets, like the CDC Ethernet
      Model gadget driver)
    - data capture drivers, perhaps video4Linux or a scanner driver; or
      test and measurement hardware.
    - input subsystem (for HID gadgets)
    - sound subsystem (for audio gadgets)
    - file system (for PTP gadgets)
    - block i/o subsystem (for usb-storage gadgets)
    - ... and more

*Additional Layers*
:   Other layers may exist. These could include kernel layers, such as
    network protocol stacks, as well as user mode applications building
    on standard POSIX system call APIs such as `open()`, `close()`,
    `read()` and `write()`. On newer systems, POSIX Async I/O calls may
    be an option. Such user mode code will not necessarily be subject to
    the GNU General Public License (GPL).

OTG-capable systems will also need to include a standard Linux-USB host
side stack, with `usbcore`, one or more *Host Controller Drivers*
(HCDs), *USB Device Drivers* to support the OTG "Targeted Peripheral
List", and so forth. There will also be an *OTG Controller Driver*,
which is visible to gadget and device driver developers only indirectly.
That helps the host and device side USB controllers implement the two
new OTG protocols (HNP and SRP). Roles switch (host to peripheral, or
vice versa) using HNP during USB suspend processing, and SRP can be
viewed as a more battery-friendly kind of device wakeup protocol.

Over time, reusable utilities are evolving to help make some gadget
driver tasks simpler. For example, building configuration descriptors
from vectors of descriptors for the configurations interfaces and
endpoints is now automated, and many drivers now use autoconfiguration
to choose hardware endpoints and initialize their descriptors. A
potential example of particular interest is code implementing standard
USB-IF protocols for HID, networking, storage, or audio classes. Some
developers are interested in KDB or KGDB hooks, to let target hardware
be remotely debugged. Most such USB protocol code doesn't need to be
hardware-specific, any more than network protocols like X11, HTTP, or
NFS are. Such gadget-side interface drivers should eventually be
combined, to implement composite devices.

## Kernel Mode Gadget API

Gadget drivers declare themselves through a struct
[`usb_gadget_driver`](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget_driver "usb_gadget_driver"), which is responsible for most parts of enumeration
for a [`struct usb_gadget`](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget "usb_gadget"). The response to a set_configuration usually
involves enabling one or more of the [`struct usb_ep`](gadget.md#c.usb_ep "usb_ep") objects exposed by
the gadget, and submitting one or more [`struct usb_request`](gadget.md#c.usb_request "usb_request") buffers to
transfer data. Understand those four data types, and their operations,
and you will understand how this API works.

The core API does not expose every possible hardware feature, only the
most widely available ones. There are significant hardware features,
such as device-to-device DMA (without temporary storage in a memory
buffer) that would be added using hardware-specific APIs.

This API allows drivers to use conditional compilation to handle
endpoint capabilities of different hardware, but doesn't require that.
Hardware tends to have arbitrary restrictions, relating to transfer
types, addressing, packet sizes, buffering, and availability. As a rule,
such differences only matter for "endpoint zero" logic that handles
device configuration and management. The API supports limited run-time
detection of capabilities, through naming conventions for endpoints.
Many drivers will be able to at least partially autoconfigure
themselves. In particular, driver init sections will often have endpoint
autoconfiguration logic that scans the hardware's list of endpoints to
find ones matching the driver requirements (relying on those
conventions), to eliminate some of the most common reasons for
conditional compilation.

Like the Linux-USB host side API, this API exposes the "chunky" nature
of USB messages: I/O requests are in terms of one or more "packets", and
packet boundaries are visible to drivers. Compared to RS-232 serial
protocols, USB resembles synchronous protocols like HDLC (N bytes per
frame, multipoint addressing, host as the primary station and devices as
secondary stations) more than asynchronous ones (tty style: 8 data bits
per frame, no parity, one stop bit). So for example the controller
drivers won't buffer two single byte writes into a single two-byte USB
IN packet, although gadget drivers may do so when they implement
protocols where packet boundaries (and "short packets") are not
significant.

### Driver Life Cycle

Gadget drivers make endpoint I/O requests to hardware without needing to
know many details of the hardware, but driver setup/configuration code
needs to handle some differences. Use the API like this:

1. Register a driver for the particular device side usb controller
   hardware, such as the net2280 on PCI (USB 2.0), sa11x0 or pxa25x as
   found in Linux PDAs, and so on. At this point the device is logically
   in the USB ch9 initial state (`attached`), drawing no power and not
   usable (since it does not yet support enumeration). Any host should
   not see the device, since it's not activated the data line pullup
   used by the host to detect a device, even if VBUS power is available.
2. Register a gadget driver that implements some higher level device
   function. That will then bind() to a [`usb_gadget`](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget "usb_gadget"), which activates
   the data line pullup sometime after detecting VBUS.
3. The hardware driver can now start enumerating. The steps it handles
   are to accept USB `power` and `set_address` requests. Other steps are
   handled by the gadget driver. If the gadget driver module is unloaded
   before the host starts to enumerate, steps before step 7 are skipped.
4. The gadget driver's `setup()` call returns usb descriptors, based both
   on what the bus interface hardware provides and on the functionality
   being implemented. That can involve alternate settings or
   configurations, unless the hardware prevents such operation. For OTG
   devices, each configuration descriptor includes an OTG descriptor.
5. The gadget driver handles the last step of enumeration, when the USB
   host issues a `set_configuration` call. It enables all endpoints used
   in that configuration, with all interfaces in their default settings.
   That involves using a list of the hardware's endpoints, enabling each
   endpoint according to its descriptor. It may also involve using
   `usb_gadget_vbus_draw` to let more power be drawn from VBUS, as
   allowed by that configuration. For OTG devices, setting a
   configuration may also involve reporting HNP capabilities through a
   user interface.
6. Do real work and perform data transfers, possibly involving changes
   to interface settings or switching to new configurations, until the
   device is disconnect()ed from the host. Queue any number of transfer
   requests to each endpoint. It may be suspended and resumed several
   times before being disconnected. On disconnect, the drivers go back
   to step 3 (above).
7. When the gadget driver module is being unloaded, the driver unbind()
   callback is issued. That lets the controller driver be unloaded.

Drivers will normally be arranged so that just loading the gadget driver
module (or statically linking it into a Linux kernel) allows the
peripheral device to be enumerated, but some drivers will defer
enumeration until some higher level component (like a user mode daemon)
enables it. Note that at this lowest level there are no policies about
how ep0 configuration logic is implemented, except that it should obey
USB specifications. Such issues are in the domain of gadget drivers,
including knowing about implementation constraints imposed by some USB
controllers or understanding that composite devices might happen to be
built by integrating reusable components.

Note that the lifecycle above can be slightly different for OTG devices.
Other than providing an additional OTG descriptor in each configuration,
only the HNP-related differences are particularly visible to driver
code. They involve reporting requirements during the `SET_CONFIGURATION`
request, and the option to invoke HNP during some suspend callbacks.
Also, SRP changes the semantics of `usb_gadget_wakeup` slightly.

### USB 2.0 Chapter 9 Types and Constants

Gadget drivers rely on common USB structures and constants defined in
the [linux/usb/ch9.h](usb.md#usb-chapter9) header file, which is standard in
Linux 2.6+ kernels. These are the same types and constants used by host side
drivers (and usbcore).

### Core Objects and Methods

These are declared in `<linux/usb/gadget.h>`, and are used by gadget
drivers to interact with USB peripheral controller drivers.

struct usb_request
:   describes one i/o request

**Definition**:

```
struct usb_request {
    void *buf;
    unsigned length;
    dma_addr_t dma;
    struct scatterlist      *sg;
    unsigned num_sgs;
    unsigned num_mapped_sgs;
    unsigned stream_id:16;
    unsigned is_last:1;
    unsigned no_interrupt:1;
    unsigned zero:1;
    unsigned short_not_ok:1;
    unsigned dma_mapped:1;
    void (*complete)(struct usb_ep *ep, struct usb_request *req);
    void *context;
    struct list_head        list;
    unsigned frame_number;
    int status;
    unsigned actual;
};
```

**Members**

`buf`
:   Buffer used for data. Always provide this; some controllers
    only use PIO, or don't use DMA for some endpoints.

`length`
:   Length of that data

`dma`
:   DMA address corresponding to 'buf'. If you don't set this
    field, and the usb controller needs one, it is responsible
    for mapping and unmapping the buffer.

`sg`
:   a scatterlist for SG-capable controllers.

`num_sgs`
:   number of SG entries

`num_mapped_sgs`
:   number of SG entries mapped to DMA (internal)

`stream_id`
:   The stream id, when USB3.0 bulk streams are being used

`is_last`
:   Indicates if this is the last request of a stream_id before
    switching to a different stream (required for DWC3 controllers).

`no_interrupt`
:   If true, hints that no completion irq is needed.
    Helpful sometimes with deep request queues that are handled
    directly by DMA controllers.

`zero`
:   If true, when writing data, makes the last packet be "short"
    by adding a zero length packet as needed;

`short_not_ok`
:   When reading data, makes short packets be
    treated as errors (queue stops advancing till cleanup).

`dma_mapped`
:   Indicates if request has been mapped to DMA (internal)

`complete`
:   Function called when request completes, so this request and
    its buffer may be re-used. The function will always be called with
    interrupts disabled, and it must not sleep.
    Reads terminate with a short packet, or when the buffer fills,
    whichever comes first. When writes terminate, some data bytes
    will usually still be in flight (often in a hardware fifo).
    Errors (for reads or writes) stop the queue from advancing
    until the completion function returns, so that any transfers
    invalidated by the error may first be dequeued.

`context`
:   For use by the completion callback

`list`
:   For use by the gadget driver.

`frame_number`
:   Reports the interval number in (micro)frame in which the
    isochronous transfer was transmitted or received.

`status`
:   Reports completion code, zero or a negative errno.
    Normally, faults block the transfer queue from advancing until
    the completion callback returns.
    Code "-ESHUTDOWN" indicates completion caused by device disconnect,
    or when the driver disabled the endpoint.

`actual`
:   Reports bytes transferred to/from the buffer. For reads (OUT
    transfers) this may be less than the requested length. If the
    short_not_ok flag is set, short reads are treated as errors
    even when status otherwise indicates successful completion.
    Note that for writes (IN transfers) some data bytes may still
    reside in a device-side FIFO when the request is reported as
    complete.

**Description**

These are allocated/freed through the endpoint they're used with. The
hardware's driver can add extra per-request data to the memory it returns,
which often avoids separate memory allocations (potential failures),
later when the request is queued.

Request flags affect request handling, such as whether a zero length
packet is written (the "zero" flag), whether a short read should be
treated as an error (blocking request queue advance, the "short_not_ok"
flag), or hinting that an interrupt is not required (the "no_interrupt"
flag, for use with deep request queues).

Bulk endpoints can use any size buffers, and can also be used for interrupt
transfers. interrupt-only endpoints can be much less functional.

**NOTE**

this is analogous to '[`struct urb`](usb.md#c.urb "urb")' on the host side, except that
it's thinner and promotes more pre-allocation.

struct usb_ep_caps
:   endpoint capabilities description

**Definition**:

```
struct usb_ep_caps {
    unsigned type_control:1;
    unsigned type_iso:1;
    unsigned type_bulk:1;
    unsigned type_int:1;
    unsigned dir_in:1;
    unsigned dir_out:1;
};
```

**Definition**:

```
struct usb_ep {
    void *driver_data;
    const char              *name;
    const struct usb_ep_ops *ops;
    struct list_head        ep_list;
    struct usb_ep_caps      caps;
    bool claimed;

    enabled and remains valid until the endpoint is disabled.

`comp_desc`
:   In case of SuperSpeed support, this is the endpoint companion
    descriptor that is used to configure the endpoint

**Description**

the bus controller driver lists all the general purpose endpoints in
gadget->ep_list. the control endpoint (gadget->ep0) is not in that list,
and is accessed only in response to a driver setup() callback.

**Description**

Gadgets have a mostly-portable "gadget driver" implementing device
functions, handling all usb configurations and interfaces. Gadget
drivers talk to hardware-specific code indirectly, through ops vectors.
That insulates the gadget driver from hardware details, and packages
the hardware endpoints through generic i/o queues. The "usb_gadget"
and "usb_ep" interfaces provide that insulation from the hardware.

Except for the driver data, all fields in this structure are
read-only to the gadget driver. That driver data is part of the
"driver model" infrastructure in 2.6 (and later) kernels, and for
earlier systems is grouped in a similar structure that's not known
to the rest of the kernel.

Values of the three OTG device feature flags are updated before the
setup() call corresponding to USB_REQ_SET_CONFIGURATION, and before
driver suspend() calls. They are valid only when is_otg, and when the
device is acting as a B-Peripheral (so is_a_peripheral is false).

struct usb_gadget_driver
:   driver for usb gadget devices

**Definition**:

```
struct usb_gadget_driver {
    char *function;
    enum usb_device_speed   max_speed;
    int (*bind)(struct usb_gadget *gadget, struct usb_gadget_driver *driver);
    void (*unbind)(struct usb_gadget *);
    int (*setup)(struct usb_gadget *, const struct usb_ctrlrequest *);
    void (*disconnect)(struct usb_gadget *);
    void (*suspend)(struct usb_gadget *);
    void (*resume)(struct usb_gadget *);
    void (*reset)(struct usb_gadget *);
    struct device_driver    driver;
    char *udc_name;
    unsigned match_existing_only:1;
    bool is_bound:1;
};
```

**Members**

`function`
:   String describing the gadget's function

`max_speed`
:   Highest speed the driver handles.

`bind`
:   the driver's bind callback

`unbind`
:   Invoked when the driver is unbound from a gadget,
    usually from rmmod (after a disconnect is reported).
    Called in a context that permits sleeping.

`setup`
:   Invoked for ep0 control requests that aren't handled by
    the hardware level driver. Most calls must be handled by
    the gadget driver, including descriptor and configuration
    management. The 16 bit members of the setup data are in
    USB byte order. Called in_interrupt; this may not sleep. Driver
    queues a response to ep0, or returns negative to stall.

`disconnect`
:   Invoked after all transfers have been stopped,
    when the host is disconnected. May be called in_interrupt; this
    may not sleep. Some devices can't detect disconnect, so this might
    not be called except as part of controller shutdown.

`suspend`
:   Invoked on USB suspend. May be called in_interrupt.

`resume`
:   Invoked on USB resume. May be called in_interrupt.

`reset`
:   Invoked on USB bus reset. It is mandatory for all gadget drivers
    and should be called in_interrupt.

`driver`
:   Driver model state for this driver.

`udc_name`
:   A name of UDC this driver should be bound to. If udc_name is NULL,
    this driver will be bound to any available UDC.

`match_existing_only`
:   If udc is not found, return an error and fail
    the driver registration

`is_bound`
:   Allow a driver to be bound to only one gadget

**Description**

Devices are disabled till a gadget driver successfully bind()s, which
means the driver will handle setup() requests needed to enumerate (and
meet "chapter 9" requirements) then do some useful work.

If gadget->is_otg is true, the gadget driver must provide an OTG
descriptor during enumeration, or else fail the bind() call. In such
cases, no USB traffic may flow until both bind() returns without
having called usb_gadget_disconnect(), and the USB host stack has
initialized.

Drivers use hardware-specific knowledge to configure the usb hardware.
endpoint addressing is only one of several hardware characteristics that
are in descriptors the ep0 implementation returns from setup() calls.

Except for ep0 implementation, most driver code shouldn't need change to
run on top of different usb controllers. It'll use endpoints set up by
that ep0 implementation.

The usb controller driver handles a few standard usb requests. Those
include set_address, and feature flags for devices, interfaces, and
endpoints (the get_status, set_feature, and clear_feature requests).

Accordingly, the driver's setup() callback must always implement all
get_descriptor requests, returning at least a device descriptor and
a configuration descriptor. Drivers must make sure the endpoint
descriptors match any hardware constraints. Some hardware also constrains
other descriptors. (The pxa250 allows only configurations 1, 2, or 3).

The driver's setup() callback must also implement set_configuration,
and should also implement set_interface, get_configuration, and
get_interface. Setting a configuration (or interface) is where
endpoints should be activated or (config 0) shut down.

The gadget driver's setup() callback does not have to queue a response to
ep0 within the setup() call, the driver can do it after setup() returns.
The UDC driver must wait until such a response is queued before proceeding
with the data/status stages of the control transfer.

(Note that only the default control endpoint is supported. Neither
hosts nor devices generally support control traffic except to ep0.)

Most devices will ignore USB suspend/resume operations, and so will
not provide those callbacks. However, some may need to change modes
when the host is not longer directing those activities. For example,
local controls (buttons, dials, etc) may need to be re-enabled since
the (remote) host can't do that any longer; or an error state might
be cleared, to make the device behave identically whether or not
power is maintained.

**NOTE**

Currently, a number of UDC drivers rely on USB_GADGET_DELAYED_STATUS
being returned from the setup() callback, which is a bug. See the comment
next to USB_GADGET_DELAYED_STATUS for details.

int usb_gadget_register_driver_owner(struct [usb_gadget_driver](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget_driver "usb_gadget_driver") \*driver, struct module \*owner, const char \*mod_name)
:   register a gadget driver

**Parameters**

`struct usb_gadget_driver *driver`
:   the driver being registered

`struct module *owner`
:   the driver module

`const char *mod_name`
:   the driver module's build name

**Context**

can sleep

**Description**

Call this in your gadget driver's module initialization function,
to tell the underlying UDC controller driver about your driver.
The **bind()** function will be called to bind it to a gadget before this
registration call returns. It's expected that the **bind()** function will
be in init sections.

Use the macro defined below instead of calling this directly.

int usb_gadget_unregister_driver(struct [usb_gadget_driver](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget_driver "usb_gadget_driver") \*driver)
:   unregister a gadget driver

**Parameters**

`struct usb_gadget_driver *driver`
:   the driver being unregistered

**Context**

can sleep

**Description**

Call this in your gadget driver's module cleanup function,
to tell the underlying usb controller that your driver is
going away. If the controller is connected to a USB host,
it will first disconnect(). The driver is also requested
to unbind() and clean up any device state, before this procedure
finally returns. It's expected that the unbind() functions
will be in exit sections, so may not be linked in some kernels.

struct usb_string
:   wraps a C string and its USB id

**Definition**:

```
struct usb_string {
    u8 id;
    const char              *s;
};
```

**Members**

`id`
:   the (nonzero) ID for this string

`s`
:   the string, in UTF-8 encoding

**Description**

If you're using [`usb_gadget_get_string()`](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget_get_string "usb_gadget_get_string"), use this to wrap a string
together with its ID.

struct usb_gadget_strings
:   a set of USB strings in a given language

**Definition**:

```
struct usb_gadget_strings {
    u16 language;
    struct usb_string       *strings;
};
```

**Members**

`language`
:   identifies the strings' language (0x0409 for en-us)

`strings`
:   array of strings with their ids

**Description**

If you're using [`usb_gadget_get_string()`](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget_get_string "usb_gadget_get_string"), use this to wrap all the
strings for a given language.

void usb_free_descriptors(struct usb_descriptor_header \*\*v)
:   free descriptors returned by [`usb_copy_descriptors()`](gadget.md#c.usb_copy_descriptors "usb_copy_descriptors")

**Parameters**

`struct usb_descriptor_header **v`
:   vector of descriptors

### Optional Utilities

The core API is sufficient for writing a USB Gadget Driver, but some
optional utilities are provided to simplify common tasks. These
utilities include endpoint autoconfiguration.

int usb_gadget_get_string(const struct [usb_gadget_strings](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget_strings "usb_gadget_strings") \*table, int id, u8 \*buf)
:   fill out a string descriptor

**Parameters**

`const struct usb_gadget_strings *table`
:   of c strings encoded using UTF-8

`int id`
:   string id, from low byte of wValue in get string descriptor

`u8 *buf`
:   at least 256 bytes, must be 16-bit aligned

**Description**

Finds the UTF-8 string matching the ID, and converts it into a
string descriptor in utf16-le.
Returns length of descriptor (always even) or negative errno

If your driver needs stings in multiple languages, you'll probably
"switch (wIndex) { ... }" in your ep0 string descriptor logic,
using this routine after choosing which set of UTF-8 strings to use.
Note that US-ASCII is a strict subset of UTF-8; any string bytes with
the eighth bit set will be multibyte UTF-8 characters, not ISO-8859/1
characters (which are also widely used in C strings).

bool usb_validate_langid(u16 langid)
:   validate usb language identifiers

**Parameters**

`u16 langid`
:   usb language identifier

**Description**

Returns true for valid language identifier, otherwise false.

int usb_descriptor_fillbuf(void \*buf, unsigned buflen, const struct usb_descriptor_header \*\*src)
:   fill buffer with descriptors

**Parameters**

`void *buf`
:   Buffer to be filled

`unsigned buflen`
:   Size of buf

`const struct usb_descriptor_header **src`
:   Array of descriptor pointers, terminated by null pointer.

**Description**

Copies descriptors into the buffer, returning the length or a
negative error code if they can't all be copied. Useful when
assembling descriptors for an associated set of interfaces used
as part of configuring a composite device; or in other cases where
sets of descriptors need to be marshaled.

int usb_gadget_config_buf(const struct usb_config_descriptor \*config, void \*buf, unsigned length, const struct usb_descriptor_header \*\*desc)
:   builts a complete configuration descriptor

**Parameters**

`const struct usb_config_descriptor *config`
:   Header for the descriptor, including characteristics such
    as power requirements and number of interfaces.

`void *buf`
:   Buffer for the resulting configuration descriptor.

`unsigned length`
:   Length of buffer. If this is not big enough to hold the
    entire configuration descriptor, an error code will be returned.

`const struct usb_descriptor_header **desc`
:   Null-terminated vector of pointers to the descriptors (interface,
    endpoint, etc) defining all functions in this device configuration.

**Description**

This copies descriptors into the response buffer, building a descriptor
for that configuration. It returns the buffer length or a negative
status code. The config.wTotalLength field is set to match the length
of the result, but other descriptor fields (including power usage and
interface count) must be set by the caller.

Gadget drivers could use this when constructing a config descriptor
in response to USB_REQ_GET_DESCRIPTOR. They will need to patch the
resulting bDescriptorType value if USB_DT_OTHER_SPEED_CONFIG is needed.

struct usb_descriptor_header \*\*usb_copy_descriptors(struct usb_descriptor_header \*\*src)
:   copy a vector of USB descriptors

**Parameters**

`struct usb_descriptor_header **src`
:   null-terminated vector to copy

**Context**

initialization code, which may sleep

**Description**

This makes a copy of a vector of USB descriptors. Its primary use
is to support usb_function objects which can have multiple copies,
each needing different descriptors. Functions may have static
tables of descriptors, which are used as templates and customized
with identifiers (for interfaces, strings, endpoints, and more)
as needed by a given function instance.

### Composite Device Framework

The core API is sufficient for writing drivers for composite USB devices
(with more than one function in a given configuration), and also
multi-configuration devices (also more than one function, but not
necessarily sharing a given configuration). There is however an optional
framework which makes it easier to reuse and combine functions.

Devices using this framework provide a [`struct usb_composite_driver`](gadget.md#c.usb_composite_driver "usb_composite_driver"),
which in turn provides one or more [`struct usb_configuration`](gadget.md#c.usb_configuration "usb_configuration")
instances. Each such configuration includes at least one struct
[`usb_function`](gadget.md#c.usb_function "usb_function"), which packages a user visible role such as "network
link" or "mass storage device". Management functions may also exist,
such as "Device Firmware Upgrade".

    bool func_suspended;
    bool func_wakeup_armed;
};
```

**Members**

`name`
:   For diagnostics, identifies the function.

`strings`
:   tables of strings, keyed by identifiers assigned during bind()
    and by language IDs provided in control requests

`fs_descriptors`
:   Table of full (or low) speed descriptors, using interface and
    string identifiers assigned during **bind()**. If this pointer is null,
    the function will not be available at full speed (or at low speed).

`hs_descriptors`

    string identifiers assigned during **bind()**. If this pointer is null,
    the function will not be available at high speed.

`ss_descriptors`
:   Table of super speed descriptors, using interface and
    string identifiers assigned during **bind()**. If this
    pointer is null after initiation, the function will not
    be available at super speed.

`ssp_descriptors`
:   Table of super speed plus descriptors, using
    interface and string identifiers assigned during **bind()**. If
    this pointer is null after initiation, the function will not
    be available at super speed plus.

`config`
:   assigned when **[`usb_add_function()`](gadget.md#c.usb_add_function "usb_add_function")** is called; this is the
    configuration with which this function is associated.

`os_desc_table`

    can expose more than one interface. If an interface is a member of
    an IAD, only the first interface of IAD has its entry in the table.

`os_desc_n`
:   Number of entries in os_desc_table

`bind`
:   Before the gadget can register, all of its functions bind() to the
    available resources including string and interface identifiers used
    in interface or class descriptors; endpoints; I/O buffers; and so on.

    initialize usb_ep.driver data at this time (when it is used).
    Note that setting an interface to its current altsetting resets
    interface state, and that all interfaces have a disabled state.

`get_alt`
:   Returns the active altsetting. If this is not provided,

:   Indicates whether the function is in function suspend state.

`func_wakeup_armed`
:   Indicates whether the function is armed by the host for
    wakeup signaling.

**Description**

A single USB function uses one or more interfaces, and should in most
cases support operation at both full and high speeds. Each function is
associated by **[`usb_add_function()`](gadget.md#c.usb_add_function "usb_add_function")** with a one configuration; that function
causes **bind()** to be called so resources can be allocated as part of
setting up a gadget driver. Those resources include endpoints, which
should be allocated using **usb_ep_autoconfig()**.

To support dual speed operation, a function driver provides descriptors
for both high and full speed operation. Except in rare cases that don't
involve bulk endpoints, each speed needs different endpoint descriptors.

Function drivers choose their own strategies for managing instance data.
The simplest strategy just declares it "static', which means the function
can only be activated once. If the function needs to be exposed in more
than one configuration at a given speed, it needs to support multiple
usb_function structures (one for each configuration).

A more complex strategy might encapsulate a **usb_function** structure inside
a driver-specific instance structure to allows multiple activations. An
example of multiple activations might be a CDC ACM function that supports
two or more distinct instances within the same configuration, providing
several independent logical data links to a USB host.

struct usb_configuration

    Examples include OTG and vendor-specific descriptors.

`unbind`

    device infrastructure or directed at a specific interface.

    the device associated with this configuration.

**Description**

Configurations are building blocks for gadget drivers structured around
function drivers. Simple USB gadgets require only one function and one
configuration, and handle dual-speed hardware by always providing the same
functionality. Slightly more complex gadgets may have more than one
single-function configuration at a given speed; or have configurations
that only work at one speed.

Composite devices are, by definition, ones with configurations which
include more than one function.

The lifecycle of a usb_configuration includes allocation, initialization
of the fields described above, and calling **[`usb_add_config()`](gadget.md#c.usb_add_config "usb_add_config")** to set up
internal data and bind it to a specific device. The configuration's
**bind()** method is then used to initialize all the functions and then
call **[`usb_add_function()`](gadget.md#c.usb_add_function "usb_add_function")** for them.

Those functions would normally be independent of each other, but that's
not mandatory. CDC WMC devices are an example where functions often
depend on other functions, with some functions subsidiary to others.
Such interdependency may be managed in any way, so long as all of the
descriptors complete by the time the composite driver returns from
its bind() routine.

struct usb_composite_driver
:   groups configurations into a gadget

**Members**

`name`
:   For diagnostics, identifies the driver.

`dev`
:   Template descriptor for the device, including default device
    identifiers.

`strings`
:   tables of strings, keyed by identifiers assigned during **bind**
    and language IDs provided in control requests. Note: The first entries
    are predefined. The first entry that may be used is
    USB_GADGET_FIRST_AVAIL_IDX

`max_speed`
:   Highest speed the driver supports.

`needs_serial`
:   set to 1 if the gadget needs userspace to provide
    a serial number. If one is not provided, warning will be printed.

`bind`
:   (REQUIRED) Used to allocate resources that are shared across the
    whole device, such as string IDs, and add its configurations using
    **[`usb_add_config()`](gadget.md#c.usb_add_config "usb_add_config")**. This may fail by returning a negative errno
    value; it should return zero on successful initialization.

`unbind`
:   Reverses **bind**; called as a side effect of unregistering
    this driver.

`disconnect`
:   optional driver disconnect method

`suspend`
:   Notifies when the host stops sending USB traffic,
    after function notifications

`resume`
:   Notifies configuration when the host restarts USB traffic,
    before function notifications

`gadget_driver`
:   Gadget driver controlling this driver

**Description**

Devices default to reporting self powered operation. Devices which rely
on bus powered operation should report this in their **bind** method.

Before returning from **bind**, various fields in the template descriptor
may be overridden. These include the idVendor/idProduct/bcdDevice values
normally to bind the appropriate host side driver, and the three strings
(iManufacturer, iProduct, iSerialNumber) normally used to provide user
meaningful device identifiers. (The strings will not be defined unless
they are defined in **dev** and **strings**.) The correct ep0 maxpacket size
is also reported, as defined by the underlying controller driver.

**Parameters**

`__usb_composite_driver`
:   usb_composite_driver struct

**Description**

Helper macro for USB gadget composite drivers which do not do anything
special in module init/exit. This eliminates a lot of boilerplate. Each

int config_ep_by_speed_and_alt(struct [usb_gadget](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget "usb_gadget") \*g, struct [usb_function](gadget.md#c.usb_function "usb_function") \*f, struct [usb_ep](gadget.md#c.usb_ep "usb_ep") \*_ep, u8 alt)
:   configures the given endpoint according to gadget speed.

**Parameters**

`struct usb_gadget *g`
:   pointer to the gadget

`struct usb_function *f`
:   usb function

`struct usb_ep *_ep`
:   the endpoint to configure

`u8 alt`
:   alternate setting number

**Return**

error code, 0 on success

**Description**

This function chooses the right descriptors for a given
endpoint according to gadget speed and saves it in the
endpoint desc field. If the endpoint already has a descriptor
assigned to it - overwrites it with currently corresponding
descriptor. The endpoint maxpacket field is updated according
to the chosen descriptor.

**Note**

the supplied function should hold all the descriptors
for supported speeds

int config_ep_by_speed(struct [usb_gadget](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget "usb_gadget") \*g, struct [usb_function](gadget.md#c.usb_function "usb_function") \*f, struct [usb_ep](gadget.md#c.usb_ep "usb_ep") \*_ep)
:   configures the given endpoint according to gadget speed.

**Parameters**

`struct usb_gadget *g`
:   pointer to the gadget

`struct usb_function *f`
:   usb function

`struct usb_ep *_ep`
:   the endpoint to configure

**Return**

error code, 0 on success

**Description**

This function chooses the right descriptors for a given
endpoint according to gadget speed and saves it in the
endpoint desc field. If the endpoint already has a descriptor
assigned to it - overwrites it with currently corresponding
descriptor. The endpoint maxpacket field is updated according
to the chosen descriptor.

**Note**

the supplied function should hold all the descriptors
for supported speeds

int usb_add_function(struct [usb_configuration](gadget.md#c.usb_configuration "usb_configuration") \*config, struct [usb_function](gadget.md#c.usb_function "usb_function") \*function)
:   add a function to a configuration

**Parameters**

`struct usb_configuration *config`
:   the configuration

`struct usb_function *function`
:   the function being added

**Context**

single threaded during gadget setup

**Description**

After initialization, each configuration must have one or more
functions added to it. Adding a function involves calling its **bind()**
method to allocate resources such as interface and string identifiers
and endpoints.

This function returns the value of the function's bind(), which is
zero for success else a negative errno value.

int usb_function_deactivate(struct [usb_function](gadget.md#c.usb_function "usb_function") \*function)
:   prevent function and gadget enumeration

**Parameters**

`struct usb_function *function`
:   the function that isn't yet ready to respond

**Description**

Blocks response of the gadget driver to host enumeration by
preventing the data line pullup from being activated. This is
normally called during **bind()** processing to change from the
initial "ready to respond" state, or when a required resource
becomes available.

For example, drivers that serve as a passthrough to a userspace
daemon can block enumeration unless that daemon (such as an OBEX,
MTP, or print server) is ready to handle host requests.

Not all systems support software control of their USB peripheral
data pullups.

Returns zero on success, else negative errno.

int usb_function_activate(struct [usb_function](gadget.md#c.usb_function "usb_function") \*function)
:   allow function and gadget enumeration

**Parameters**

`struct usb_function *function`
:   function on which [`usb_function_activate()`](gadget.md#c.usb_function_activate "usb_function_activate") was called

**Description**

Reverses effect of [`usb_function_deactivate()`](gadget.md#c.usb_function_deactivate "usb_function_deactivate"). If no more functions
are delaying their activation, the gadget driver will respond to
host enumeration procedures.

Returns zero on success, else negative errno.

int usb_interface_id(struct [usb_configuration](gadget.md#c.usb_configuration "usb_configuration") \*config, struct [usb_function](gadget.md#c.usb_function "usb_function") \*function)
:   allocate an unused interface ID

**Parameters**

`struct usb_configuration *config`
:   configuration associated with the interface

`struct usb_function *function`
:   function handling the interface

**Context**

single threaded during gadget setup

**Description**

[`usb_interface_id()`](gadget.md#c.usb_interface_id "usb_interface_id") is called from usb_function.bind() callbacks to
allocate new interface IDs. The function driver will then store that
ID in interface, association, CDC union, and other descriptors. It
will also handle any control requests targeted at that interface,
particularly changing its altsetting via set_alt(). There may
also be class-specific or vendor-specific requests to handle.

All interface identifier should be allocated using this routine, to
ensure that for example different functions don't wrongly assign
different meanings to the same identifier. Note that since interface
identifiers are configuration-specific, functions used in more than
one configuration (or more than once in a given configuration) need
multiple versions of the relevant descriptors.

Returns the interface ID which was allocated; or -ENODEV if no
more interface IDs can be allocated.

int usb_func_wakeup(struct [usb_function](gadget.md#c.usb_function "usb_function") \*func)
:   sends function wake notification to the host.

**Parameters**

`struct usb_function *func`
:   function that sends the remote wakeup notification.

**Description**

Applicable to devices operating at enhanced superspeed when usb
functions are put in function suspend state and armed for function
remote wakeup. On completion, function wake notification is sent. If
the device is in low power state it tries to bring the device to active
state before sending the wake notification. Since it is a synchronous
call, caller must take care of not calling it in interrupt context.
For devices operating at lower speeds returns negative errno.

Returns zero on success, else negative errno.

int usb_add_config(struct [usb_composite_dev](gadget.md#c.usb_composite_dev "usb_composite_dev") \*cdev, struct [usb_configuration](gadget.md#c.usb_configuration "usb_configuration") \*config, int (\*bind)(struct [usb_configuration](gadget.md#c.usb_configuration "usb_configuration")\*))
:   add a configuration to a device.

**Parameters**

`struct usb_composite_dev *cdev`
:   wraps the USB gadget

`struct usb_configuration *config`
:   the configuration, with bConfigurationValue assigned

`int (*bind)(struct usb_configuration *)`
:   the configuration's bind function

**Context**

single threaded during gadget setup

**Description**

One of the main tasks of a composite **bind()** routine is to
add each of the configurations it supports, using this routine.

This function returns the value of the configuration's **bind()**, which
is zero for success else a negative errno value. Binding configurations
assigns global resources including string IDs, and per-configuration
resources such as interface IDs and endpoints.

int usb_string_id(struct [usb_composite_dev](gadget.md#c.usb_composite_dev "usb_composite_dev") \*cdev)
:   allocate an unused string ID

**Parameters**

`struct usb_composite_dev *cdev`
:   the device whose string descriptor IDs are being allocated

**Context**

single threaded during gadget setup

**Description**

**[`usb_string_id()`](gadget.md#c.usb_string_id "usb_string_id")** is called from bind() callbacks to allocate
string IDs. Drivers for functions, configurations, or gadgets will
then store that ID in the appropriate descriptors and string table.

All string identifier should be allocated using this,
**[`usb_string_ids_tab()`](gadget.md#c.usb_string_ids_tab "usb_string_ids_tab")** or **[`usb_string_ids_n()`](gadget.md#c.usb_string_ids_n "usb_string_ids_n")** routine, to ensure
that for example different functions don't wrongly assign different
meanings to the same identifier.

int usb_string_ids_tab(struct [usb_composite_dev](gadget.md#c.usb_composite_dev "usb_composite_dev") \*cdev, struct [usb_string](gadget.md#c.usb_string "usb_string") \*str)
:   allocate unused string IDs in batch

**Parameters**

`struct usb_composite_dev *cdev`
:   the device whose string descriptor IDs are being allocated

`struct usb_string *str`
:   an array of usb_string objects to assign numbers to

**Context**

single threaded during gadget setup

**Description**

**usb_string_ids()** is called from bind() callbacks to allocate
string IDs. Drivers for functions, configurations, or gadgets will
then copy IDs from the string table to the appropriate descriptors
and string table for other languages.

All string identifier should be allocated using this,
**[`usb_string_id()`](gadget.md#c.usb_string_id "usb_string_id")** or **[`usb_string_ids_n()`](gadget.md#c.usb_string_ids_n "usb_string_ids_n")** routine, to ensure that for
example different functions don't wrongly assign different meanings
to the same identifier.

struct [usb_string](gadget.md#c.usb_string "usb_string") \*usb_gstrings_attach(struct [usb_composite_dev](gadget.md#c.usb_composite_dev "usb_composite_dev") \*cdev, struct [usb_gadget_strings](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget_strings "usb_gadget_strings") \*\*sp, unsigned n_strings)
:   attach gadget strings to a cdev and assign ids

**Parameters**

`struct usb_composite_dev *cdev`
:   the device whose string descriptor IDs are being allocated
    and attached.

`struct usb_gadget_strings **sp`
:   an array of usb_gadget_strings to attach.

`unsigned n_strings`
:   number of entries in each usb_strings array (sp[]->strings)

**Description**

This function will create a deep copy of usb_gadget_strings and usb_string
and attach it to the cdev. The actual string (usb_string.s) will not be
copied but only a referenced will be made. The [`struct usb_gadget_strings`](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget_strings "usb_gadget_strings")
array may contain multiple languages and should be NULL terminated.
The ->language pointer of each [`struct usb_gadget_strings`](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget_strings "usb_gadget_strings") has to contain the
same amount of entries.
For instance: sp[0] is en-US, sp[1] is es-ES. It is expected that the first
usb_string entry of es-ES contains the translation of the first usb_string
entry of en-US. Therefore both entries become the same id assign.

int usb_string_ids_n(struct [usb_composite_dev](gadget.md#c.usb_composite_dev "usb_composite_dev") \*c, unsigned n)
:   allocate unused string IDs in batch

**Parameters**

`struct usb_composite_dev *c`
:   the device whose string descriptor IDs are being allocated

`unsigned n`
:   number of string IDs to allocate

**Context**

single threaded during gadget setup

**Description**

Returns the first requested ID. This ID and next **n**-1 IDs are now
valid IDs. At least provided that **n** is non-zero because if it
is, returns last requested ID which is now very useful information.

**[`usb_string_ids_n()`](gadget.md#c.usb_string_ids_n "usb_string_ids_n")** is called from bind() callbacks to allocate
string IDs. Drivers for functions, configurations, or gadgets will
then store that ID in the appropriate descriptors and string table.

All string identifier should be allocated using this,
**[`usb_string_id()`](gadget.md#c.usb_string_id "usb_string_id")** or **[`usb_string_ids_n()`](gadget.md#c.usb_string_ids_n "usb_string_ids_n")** routine, to ensure that for
example different functions don't wrongly assign different meanings
to the same identifier.

int usb_composite_probe(struct [usb_composite_driver](gadget.md#c.usb_composite_driver "usb_composite_driver") \*driver)
:   register a composite driver

**Parameters**

`struct usb_composite_driver *driver`
:   the driver to register

**Context**

single threaded during gadget setup

**Description**

This function is used to register drivers using the composite driver
framework. The return value is zero, or a negative errno value.
Those values normally come from the driver's **bind** method, which does
all the work of setting up the driver to match the hardware.

On successful return, the gadget is ready to respond to requests from
the host, unless one of its components invokes usb_gadget_disconnect()
while it was binding. That would usually be done in order to wait for
some userspace participation.

void usb_composite_unregister(struct [usb_composite_driver](gadget.md#c.usb_composite_driver "usb_composite_driver") \*driver)
:   unregister a composite driver

**Parameters**

`struct usb_composite_driver *driver`
:   the driver to unregister

**Description**

This function is used to unregister drivers using the composite
driver framework.

void usb_composite_setup_continue(struct [usb_composite_dev](gadget.md#c.usb_composite_dev "usb_composite_dev") \*cdev)
:   Continue with the control transfer

**Parameters**

`struct usb_composite_dev *cdev`
:   the composite device who's control transfer was kept waiting

**Description**

This function must be called by the USB function driver to continue
with the control transfer's data/status stage in case it had requested to
delay the data/status stages. A USB function's setup handler (e.g. set_alt())
can request the composite framework to delay the setup request's data/status
stages by returning USB_GADGET_DELAYED_STATUS.

### Composite Device Functions

At this writing, a few of the current gadget drivers have been converted
to this framework. Near-term plans include converting all of them,
except for `gadgetfs`.

## Peripheral Controller Drivers

The first hardware supporting this API was the NetChip 2280 controller,
which supports USB 2.0 high speed and is based on PCI. This is the
`net2280` driver module. The driver supports Linux kernel versions 2.4
and 2.6; contact NetChip Technologies for development boards and product
information.

Other hardware working in the `gadget` framework includes: Intel's PXA
25x and IXP42x series processors (`pxa2xx_udc`), Toshiba TC86c001
"Goku-S" (`goku_udc`), Renesas SH7705/7727 (`sh_udc`), MediaQ 11xx
(`mq11xx_udc`), Hynix HMS30C7202 (`h7202_udc`), National 9303/4
(`n9604_udc`), Texas Instruments OMAP (`omap_udc`), Sharp LH7A40x
(`lh7a40x_udc`), and more. Most of those are full speed controllers.

At this writing, there are people at work on drivers in this framework
for several other USB device controllers, with plans to make many of
them be widely available.

A partial USB simulator, the `dummy_hcd` driver, is available. It can
act like a net2280, a pxa25x, or an sa11x0 in terms of available
endpoints and device speeds; and it simulates control, bulk, and to some
extent interrupt transfers. That lets you develop some parts of a gadget
driver on a normal PC, without any special hardware, and perhaps with
the assistance of tools such as GDB running with User Mode Linux. At
least one person has expressed interest in adapting that approach,
hooking it up to a simulator for a microcontroller. Such simulators can
help debug subsystems where the runtime hardware is unfriendly to
software development, or is not yet available.

Support for other controllers is expected to be developed and
contributed over time, as this driver framework evolves.

## Gadget Drivers

In addition to *Gadget Zero* (used primarily for testing and development
with drivers for usb controller hardware), other gadget drivers exist.

There's an `ethernet` gadget driver, which implements one of the most
useful *Communications Device Class* (CDC) models. One of the standards
for cable modem interoperability even specifies the use of this ethernet
model as one of two mandatory options. Gadgets using this code look to a
USB host as if they're an Ethernet adapter. It provides access to a
network where the gadget's CPU is one host, which could easily be
bridging, routing, or firewalling access to other networks. Since some
hardware can't fully implement the CDC Ethernet requirements, this
driver also implements a "good parts only" subset of CDC Ethernet. (That
subset doesn't advertise itself as CDC Ethernet, to avoid creating
problems.)

Support for Microsoft's `RNDIS` protocol has been contributed by
Pengutronix and Auerswald GmbH. This is like CDC Ethernet, but it runs
on more slightly USB hardware (but less than the CDC subset). However,
its main claim to fame is being able to connect directly to recent
versions of Windows, using drivers that Microsoft bundles and supports,
making it much simpler to network with Windows.

There is also support for user mode gadget drivers, using `gadgetfs`.
This provides a *User Mode API* that presents each endpoint as a single
file descriptor. I/O is done using normal `read()` and `read()` calls.
Familiar tools like GDB and pthreads can be used to develop and debug
user mode drivers, so that once a robust controller driver is available
many applications for it won't require new kernel mode software. Linux
2.6 *Async I/O (AIO)* support is available, so that user mode software
can stream data with only slightly more overhead than a kernel driver.

There's a USB Mass Storage class driver, which provides a different
solution for interoperability with systems such as MS-Windows and MacOS.
That *Mass Storage* driver uses a file or block device as backing store
for a drive, like the `loop` driver. The USB host uses the BBB, CB, or
CBI versions of the mass storage class specification, using transparent
SCSI commands to access the data from the backing store.

There's a "serial line" driver, useful for TTY style operation over USB.
The latest version of that driver supports CDC ACM style operation, like
a USB modem, and so on most hardware it can interoperate easily with
MS-Windows. One interesting use of that driver is in boot firmware (like
a BIOS), which can sometimes use that model with very small systems
without real serial lines.

Support for other kinds of gadget is expected to be developed and
contributed over time, as this driver framework evolves.

## USB On-The-GO (OTG)

USB OTG support on Linux 2.6 was initially developed by Texas
Instruments for [OMAP](http://www.omap.com) 16xx and 17xx series
processors. Other OTG systems should work in similar ways, but the
hardware level details could be very different.

Systems need specialized hardware support to implement OTG, notably
including a special *Mini-AB* jack and associated transceiver to support
*Dual-Role* operation: they can act either as a host, using the standard
Linux-USB host side driver stack, or as a peripheral, using this
`gadget` framework. To do that, the system software relies on small
additions to those programming interfaces, and on a new internal
component (here called an "OTG Controller") affecting which driver stack
connects to the OTG port. In each role, the system can re-use the
existing pool of hardware-neutral drivers, layered on top of the
controller driver interfaces (`usb_bus` or [`usb_gadget`](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget "usb_gadget")).
Such drivers need at most minor changes, and most of the calls added to
support OTG can also benefit non-OTG products.

- Gadget drivers test the `is_otg` flag, and use it to determine
  whether or not to include an OTG descriptor in each of their
  configurations.
- Gadget drivers may need changes to support the two new OTG protocols,
  exposed in new gadget attributes such as `b_hnp_enable` flag. HNP
  support should be reported through a user interface (two LEDs could
  suffice), and is triggered in some cases when the host suspends the
  peripheral. SRP support can be user-initiated just like remote
  wakeup, probably by pressing the same button.
- On the host side, USB device drivers need to be taught to trigger HNP
  at appropriate moments, using `usb_suspend_device()`. That also
  conserves battery power, which is useful even for non-OTG
  configurations.
- Also on the host side, a driver must support the OTG "Targeted
  Peripheral List". That's just a whitelist, used to reject peripherals
  not supported with a given Linux OTG host. *This whitelist is
  product-specific; each product must modify* `otg_whitelist.h` *to
  match its interoperability specification.*

  Non-OTG Linux hosts, like PCs and workstations, normally have some
  solution for adding drivers, so that peripherals that aren't
  recognized can eventually be supported. That approach is unreasonable
  for consumer products that may never have their firmware upgraded,
  and where it's usually unrealistic to expect traditional
  PC/workstation/server kinds of support model to work. For example,
  it's often impractical to change device firmware once the product has
  been distributed, so driver bugs can't normally be fixed if they're
  found after shipment.

Additional changes are needed below those hardware-neutral `usb_bus`
and [`usb_gadget`](gadget.md#c.usb_gadget "usb_gadget") driver interfaces; those aren't discussed here in any
detail. Those affect the hardware-specific code for each USB Host or
Peripheral controller, and how the HCD initializes (since OTG can be
active only on a single port). They also involve what may be called an
*OTG Controller Driver*, managing the OTG transceiver and the OTG state
machine logic as well as much of the root hub behavior for the OTG port.
The OTG controller driver needs to activate and deactivate USB
controllers depending on the relevant device role. Some related changes
were needed inside usbcore, so that it can identify OTG-capable devices
and respond appropriately to HNP or SRP protocols.
