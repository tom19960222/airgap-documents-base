# 3.3. Digital TV Demux kABI

## 3.3.1. Digital TV Demux

The Kernel Digital TV Demux kABI defines a driver-internal interface for
registering low-level, hardware specific driver to a hardware independent
demux layer. It is only of interest for Digital TV device driver writers.
The header file for this kABI is named `demux.h` and located in
`include/media`.

The demux kABI should be implemented for each demux in the system. It is
used to select the TS source of a demux and to manage the demux resources.
When the demux client allocates a resource via the demux kABI, it receives
a pointer to the kABI of that resource.

Each demux receives its TS input from a DVB front-end or from memory, as
set via this demux kABI. In a system with more than one front-end, the kABI
can be used to select one of the DVB front-ends as a TS source for a demux,
unless this is fixed in the HW platform.

The demux kABI only controls front-ends regarding to their connections with
demuxes; the kABI used to set the other front-end parameters, such as
tuning, are defined via the Digital TV Frontend kABI.

The functions that implement the abstract interface demux should be defined
static or module private and registered to the Demux core for external
access. It is not necessary to implement every function in the struct
[`dmx_demux`](dtv-demux.md#c.dmx_demux "dmx_demux"). For example, a demux interface might support Section filtering,
but not PES filtering. The kABI client is expected to check the value of any
function pointer before calling the function: the value of `NULL` means
that the function is not available.

Whenever the functions of the demux API modify shared data, the
possibilities of lost update and race condition problems should be
addressed, e.g. by protecting parts of code with mutexes.

Note that functions called from a bottom half context must not sleep.
Even a simple memory allocation without using `GFP_ATOMIC` can result in a
kernel thread being put to sleep if swapping is needed. For example, the
Linux Kernel calls the functions of a network device interface from a
bottom half context. Thus, if a demux kABI function is called from network
device code, the function must not sleep.

## 3.3.2. Demux Callback API

This kernel-space API comprises the callback functions that deliver filtered
data to the demux client. Unlike the other DVB kABIs, these functions are
provided by the client and called from the demux code.

The function pointers of this abstract interface are not packed into a
structure as in the other demux APIs, because the callback functions are
registered and used independent of each other. As an example, it is possible
for the API client to provide several callback functions for receiving TS
packets and no callbacks for PES packets or sections.

The functions that implement the callback API need not be re-entrant: when
a demux driver calls one of these functions, the driver is not allowed to
call the function again before the original call returns. If a callback is
triggered by a hardware interrupt, it is recommended to use the Linux
bottom half mechanism or start a tasklet instead of making the callback
function call directly from a hardware interrupt.

This mechanism is implemented by [`dmx_ts_cb()`](dtv-demux.md#c.dmx_ts_cb "dmx_ts_cb") and [`dmx_section_cb()`](dtv-demux.md#c.dmx_section_cb "dmx_section_cb")
callbacks.

a packet start mark (0x47).

**NOTE**

The **buf** size should have size equal to `count * 204`.

void dvb_dmx_swfilter_raw(struct [dvb_demux](dtv-demux.md#c.dvb_demux "dvb_demux") \*demux, const u8 \*buf, size_t count)
:   make the raw data available to userspace without filtering

**Parameters**

`struct dvb_demux *demux`
:   pointer to [`struct dvb_demux`](dtv-demux.md#c.dvb_demux "dvb_demux")

`const u8 *buf`
:   buffer with data

`size_t count`
:   number of packets to be passed. The actual size of each packet
    depends on the [`dvb_demux->feed`](dtv-demux.md#c.dvb_demux "dvb_demux")->cb.ts logic.

**Description**

Use it if the driver needs to deliver the raw payload to userspace without
passing through the kernel demux. That is meant to support some
delivery systems that aren't based on MPEG-TS.

This function relies on [`dvb_demux->feed`](dtv-demux.md#c.dvb_demux "dvb_demux")->cb.ts to actually handle the
buffer.

    u8 filter_mode[DMX_MAX_FILTER_SIZE];
    struct dmx_section_feed *parent;
    void *priv;
};
```

**Members**

`filter_value`
:   Contains up to 16 bytes (128 bits) of the TS section header
    that will be matched by the section filter

`filter_mask`
:   Contains a 16 bytes (128 bits) filter mask with the bits
    specified by **filter_value** that will be used on the filter

    be allocated, the function fails with -ENOSPC.

`release_filter`
:   This function releases all the resources of a
    previously allocated section filter. The function
    should not be called while filtering is in progress
    on this section feed. After calling this function,

dmx_ts_cb
:   **Typedef**: DVB demux TS filter callback function prototype

**Syntax**

> `int dmx_ts_cb (const u8 *buffer1, size_t buffer1_length, const u8 *buffer2, size_t buffer2_length, struct dmx_ts_feed *source, u32 *buffer_flags)`

**Parameters**

`const u8 *buffer1`
:   Pointer to the start of the filtered TS packets.

`size_t buffer1_length`
:   Length of the TS data in buffer1.

`const u8 *buffer2`
:   Pointer to the tail of the filtered TS packets, or NULL.

`size_t buffer2_length`
:   Length of the TS data in buffer2.

`struct dmx_ts_feed *source`
:   Indicates which TS feed is the source of the callback.

`u32 *buffer_flags`
:   Address where buffer flags are stored. Those are
    used to report discontinuity users via DVB
    memory mapped API, as defined by
    [`enum dmx_buffer_flags`](../../userspace-api/media/dvb/dmx_types.md#c.dmx_buffer_flags "dmx_buffer_flags").

**Description**

This function callback prototype, provided by the client of the demux API,
is called from the demux code. The function is only called when filtering
on a TS feed has been enabled using the start_filtering() function at
the [`dmx_demux`](dtv-demux.md#c.dmx_demux "dmx_demux").
Any TS packets that match the filter settings are copied to a circular
buffer. The filtered TS packets are delivered to the client using this
callback function.
It is expected that the **buffer1** and **buffer2** callback parameters point to
addresses within the circular buffer, but other implementations are also
possible. Note that the called party should not try to free the memory
the **buffer1** and **buffer2** parameters point to.

When this function is called, the **buffer1** parameter typically points to
the start of the first undelivered TS packet within a circular buffer.
The **buffer2** buffer parameter is normally NULL, except when the received
TS packets have crossed the last address of the circular buffer and
"wrapped" to the beginning of the buffer. In the latter case the **buffer1**
parameter would contain an address within the circular buffer, while the
**buffer2** parameter would contain the first address of the circular buffer.
The number of bytes delivered with this function (i.e. **buffer1_length** +
**buffer2_length**) is usually equal to the value of callback_length parameter
given in the set() function, with one exception: if a timeout occurs before
receiving callback_length bytes of TS data, any undelivered packets are
immediately delivered to the client by calling this function. The timeout
duration is controlled by the set() function in the TS Feed API.

If a TS packet is received with errors that could not be fixed by the
TS-level forward error correction (FEC), the Transport_error_indicator
flag of the TS packet header should be set. The TS packet should not be
discarded, as the error can possibly be corrected by a higher layer
protocol. If the called party is slow in processing the callback, it
is possible that the circular buffer eventually fills up. If this happens,
the demux driver should discard any TS packets received while the buffer
is full and return -EOVERFLOW.

The type of data returned to the callback can be selected by the
[`dmx_ts_feed`](dtv-demux.md#c.dmx_ts_feed "dmx_ts_feed").\*\*set\*\* function. The type parameter decides if the raw
TS packet (TS_PACKET) or just the payload (TS_PACKET|TS_PAYLOAD_ONLY)
should be returned. If additionally the TS_DECODER bit is set the stream
will also be sent to the hardware MPEG decoder.

- 0, on success;
- -EOVERFLOW, on buffer overflow.

**Return**

dmx_section_cb
:   **Typedef**: DVB demux TS filter callback function prototype

**Syntax**

> `int dmx_section_cb (const u8 *buffer1, size_t buffer1_len, const u8 *buffer2, size_t buffer2_len, struct dmx_section_filter *source, u32 *buffer_flags)`

**Parameters**

`const u8 *buffer1`
:   Pointer to the start of the filtered section, e.g.
    within the circular buffer of the demux driver.

`size_t buffer1_len`
:   Length of the filtered section data in **buffer1**,
    including headers and CRC.

`const u8 *buffer2`
:   Pointer to the tail of the filtered section data,
    or NULL. Useful to handle the wrapping of a
    circular buffer.

`size_t buffer2_len`
:   Length of the filtered section data in **buffer2**,
    including headers and CRC.

`struct dmx_section_filter *source`
:   Indicates which section feed is the source of the
    callback.

`u32 *buffer_flags`
:   Address where buffer flags are stored. Those are
    used to report discontinuity users via DVB
    memory mapped API, as defined by
    [`enum dmx_buffer_flags`](../../userspace-api/media/dvb/dmx_types.md#c.dmx_buffer_flags "dmx_buffer_flags").

**Description**

This function callback prototype, provided by the client of the demux API,
is called from the demux code. The function is only called when
filtering of sections has been enabled using the function
[`dmx_ts_feed`](dtv-demux.md#c.dmx_ts_feed "dmx_ts_feed").\*\*start_filtering\*\*. When the demux driver has received a
complete section that matches at least one section filter, the client
is notified via this callback function. Normally this function is called
for each received section; however, it is also possible to deliver
multiple sections with one callback, for example when the system load
is high. If an error occurs while receiving a section, this
function should be called with the corresponding error type set in the
success field, whether or not there is data to deliver. The Section Feed
implementation should maintain a circular buffer for received sections.
However, this is not necessary if the Section Feed API is implemented as
a client of the TS Feed API, because the TS Feed implementation then
buffers the received data. The size of the circular buffer can be
configured using the [`dmx_ts_feed`](dtv-demux.md#c.dmx_ts_feed "dmx_ts_feed").\*\*set\*\* function in the Section Feed API.
If there is no room in the circular buffer when a new section is received,
the section must be discarded. If this happens, the value of the success
parameter should be DMX_OVERRUN_ERROR on the next callback.

};
```

**Members**

`capabilities`
:   Bitfield of capability flags.

`frontend`
:   Front-end connected to the demux

`priv`
:   Pointer to private data of the API client

`open`
:   This function reserves the demux for use by the caller and, if
    necessary, initializes the demux. When the demux is no longer needed,
    the function **close** should be called. It should be possible for
    multiple clients to access the demux at the same time. Thus, the
    function implementation should increment the demux usage count when
    **open** is called and decrement it when **close** is called.
    The **demux** function parameter contains a pointer to the demux API and
    instance data.
    It returns:
    0 on success;
    -EUSERS, if maximum usage count was reached;
    -EINVAL, on bad parameter.

`close`
:   This function reserves the demux for use by the caller and, if
    necessary, initializes the demux. When the demux is no longer needed,
    the function **close** should be called. It should be possible for
    multiple clients to access the demux at the same time. Thus, the
    function implementation should increment the demux usage count when
    **open** is called and decrement it when **close** is called.
    The **demux** function parameter contains a pointer to the demux API and
    instance data.
    It returns:
    0 on success;
    -ENODEV, if demux was not in use (e. g. no users);
    -EINVAL, on bad parameter.

`write`
:   This function provides the demux driver with a memory buffer
    containing TS packets. Instead of receiving TS packets from the DVB
    front-end, the demux driver software will read packets from memory.
    Any clients of this demux with active TS, PES or Section filters will
    receive filtered data via the Demux callback API (see 0). The function
    returns when all the data in the buffer has been consumed by the demux.
    Demux hardware typically cannot read TS from memory. If this is the
    case, memory-based filtering has to be implemented entirely in software.
    The **demux** function parameter contains a pointer to the demux API and
    instance data.
    The **buf** function parameter contains a pointer to the TS data in
    kernel-space memory.
    The **count** function parameter contains the length of the TS data.
    It returns:
    0 on success;
    -ERESTARTSYS, if mutex lock was interrupted;
    -EINTR, if a signal handling is pending;
    -ENODEV, if demux was removed;
    -EINVAL, on bad parameter.

`allocate_ts_feed`
:   Allocates a new TS feed, which is used to filter the TS
    packets carrying a certain PID. The TS feed normally corresponds to a
    hardware PID filter on the demux chip.
    The **demux** function parameter contains a pointer to the demux API and
    instance data.
    The **feed** function parameter contains a pointer to the TS feed API and
    instance data.
    The **callback** function parameter contains a pointer to the callback
    function for passing received TS packet.
    It returns:
    0 on success;
    -ERESTARTSYS, if mutex lock was interrupted;
    -EBUSY, if no more TS feeds is available;
    -EINVAL, on bad parameter.

`release_ts_feed`
:   Releases the resources allocated with **allocate_ts_feed**.
    Any filtering in progress on the TS feed should be stopped before
    calling this function.
    The **demux** function parameter contains a pointer to the demux API and
    instance data.
    The **feed** function parameter contains a pointer to the TS feed API and
    instance data.
    It returns:
    0 on success;
    -EINVAL on bad parameter.

`allocate_section_feed`
:   Allocates a new section feed, i.e. a demux resource
    for filtering and receiving sections. On platforms with hardware
    support for section filtering, a section feed is directly mapped to
    the demux HW. On other platforms, TS packets are first PID filtered in
    hardware and a hardware section filter then emulated in software. The
    caller obtains an API pointer of type dmx_section_feed_t as an out
    parameter. Using this API the caller can set filtering parameters and
    start receiving sections.
    The **demux** function parameter contains a pointer to the demux API and
    instance data.
    The **feed** function parameter contains a pointer to the TS feed API and
    instance data.
    The **callback** function parameter contains a pointer to the callback
    function for passing received TS packet.
    It returns:
    0 on success;
    -EBUSY, if no more TS feeds is available;
    -EINVAL, on bad parameter.

`release_section_feed`
:   Releases the resources allocated with
    **allocate_section_feed**, including allocated filters. Any filtering in
    progress on the section feed should be stopped before calling this
    function.
    The **demux** function parameter contains a pointer to the demux API and
    instance data.
    The **feed** function parameter contains a pointer to the TS feed API and
    instance data.
    It returns:
    0 on success;
    -EINVAL, on bad parameter.

`add_frontend`
:   Registers a connectivity between a demux and a front-end,
    i.e., indicates that the demux can be connected via a call to
    **connect_frontend** to use the given front-end as a TS source. The
    client of this function has to allocate dynamic or static memory for
    the frontend structure and initialize its fields before calling this
    function. This function is normally called during the driver
    initialization. The caller must not free the memory of the frontend
    struct before successfully calling **remove_frontend**.
    The **demux** function parameter contains a pointer to the demux API and
    instance data.
    The **frontend** function parameter contains a pointer to the front-end
    instance data.
    It returns:
    0 on success;
    -EINVAL, on bad parameter.

`remove_frontend`
:   Indicates that the given front-end, registered by a call
    to **add_frontend**, can no longer be connected as a TS source by this
    demux. The function should be called when a front-end driver or a demux
    driver is removed from the system. If the front-end is in use, the
    function fails with the return value of -EBUSY. After successfully
    calling this function, the caller can free the memory of the frontend
    struct if it was dynamically allocated before the **add_frontend**
    operation.
    The **demux** function parameter contains a pointer to the demux API and
    instance data.
    The **frontend** function parameter contains a pointer to the front-end
    instance data.
    It returns:
    0 on success;
    -ENODEV, if the front-end was not found,
    -EINVAL, on bad parameter.

`get_frontends`
:   Provides the APIs of the front-ends that have been
    registered for this demux. Any of the front-ends obtained with this
    call can be used as a parameter for **connect_frontend**. The include
    file demux.h contains the macro [`DMX_FE_ENTRY()`](dtv-demux.md#c.DMX_FE_ENTRY "DMX_FE_ENTRY") for converting an
    element of the generic type struct `list_head` \* to the type
    struct [`dmx_frontend`](dtv-demux.md#c.dmx_frontend "dmx_frontend") *. The caller must not free the memory of any of
    the elements obtained via this function call.
    The \*\*demux\** function parameter contains a pointer to the demux API and
    instance data.
    It returns a struct list_head pointer to the list of front-end
    interfaces, or NULL in the case of an empty list.

`connect_frontend`
:   Connects the TS output of the front-end to the input of
    the demux. A demux can only be connected to a front-end registered to
    the demux with the function **add_frontend**. It may or may not be
    possible to connect multiple demuxes to the same front-end, depending
    on the capabilities of the HW platform. When not used, the front-end
    should be released by calling **disconnect_frontend**.
    The **demux** function parameter contains a pointer to the demux API and
    instance data.
    The **frontend** function parameter contains a pointer to the front-end
    instance data.
    It returns:
    0 on success;
    -EINVAL, on bad parameter.

`disconnect_frontend`
:   Disconnects the demux and a front-end previously
    connected by a **connect_frontend** call.
    The **demux** function parameter contains a pointer to the demux API and
    instance data.
    It returns:
    0 on success;
    -EINVAL on bad parameter.

`get_pes_pids`
:   Get the PIDs for DMX_PES_AUDIO0, DMX_PES_VIDEO0,
    DMX_PES_TELETEXT0, DMX_PES_SUBTITLE0 and DMX_PES_PCR0.
    The **demux** function parameter contains a pointer to the demux API and
    instance data.
    The **pids** function parameter contains an array with five u16 elements
    where the PIDs will be stored.
    It returns:
    0 on success;
    -EINVAL on bad parameter.
