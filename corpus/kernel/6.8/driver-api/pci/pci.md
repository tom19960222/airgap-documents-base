int __pci_reset_function_locked(struct pci_dev \*dev)
:   reset a PCI device function while holding the **dev** mutex lock.

**Parameters**

`struct pci_dev *dev`
:   PCI device to reset

**Description**

Some devices allow an individual function to be reset without affecting
other functions in the same device. The PCI device must be responsive
to PCI config space in order to use this function.

The device function is presumed to be unused and the caller is holding
the device mutex lock when this function is called.

Resetting the device will make the contents of PCI configuration space
random, so any caller of this must be prepared to reinitialise the
device including MSI, bus mastering, BARs, decoding IO and memory spaces,
etc.

Returns 0 if the device function was successfully reset or negative if the
device doesn't support resetting a single function.

int pci_reset_function(struct pci_dev \*dev)
:   quiesce and reset a PCI device function

**Parameters**

`struct pci_dev *dev`
:   PCI device to reset

**Description**

Some devices allow an individual function to be reset without affecting
other functions in the same device. The PCI device must be responsive
to PCI config space in order to use this function.

This function does not just reset the PCI portion of a device, but
clears all the state associated with the device. This function differs
from [`__pci_reset_function_locked()`](pci.md#c.__pci_reset_function_locked "__pci_reset_function_locked") in that it saves and restores device state
over the reset and takes the PCI device lock.

Returns 0 if the device function was successfully reset or negative if the
device doesn't support resetting a single function.

int pci_reset_function_locked(struct pci_dev \*dev)
:   quiesce and reset a PCI device function

**Parameters**

`struct pci_dev *dev`
:   PCI device to reset

**Description**

Some devices allow an individual function to be reset without affecting
other functions in the same device. The PCI device must be responsive
to PCI config space in order to use this function.

This function does not just reset the PCI portion of a device, but
clears all the state associated with the device. This function differs
from [`__pci_reset_function_locked()`](pci.md#c.__pci_reset_function_locked "__pci_reset_function_locked") in that it saves and restores device state
over the reset. It also differs from [`pci_reset_function()`](pci.md#c.pci_reset_function "pci_reset_function") in that it
requires the PCI device lock to be held.

Returns 0 if the device function was successfully reset or negative if the
device doesn't support resetting a single function.

device structure is returned, and the reference count to the device is
incremented. Otherwise, `NULL` is returned. A new search is initiated by
passing `NULL` as the **from** argument. Otherwise if **from** is not `NULL`,

:   search for a PCI device with this base class code

`struct pci_dev *from`
:   Previous PCI device found in search, or `NULL` for new search.

by this function, so if that device is removed from the system right after
this function is finished, the value will be stale. Use this function to
find devices that are usually built into a system, or for a general hint as
to if another device happens to be present at this specific moment in time.

`const char *fmt`
:   Printf-like format string naming the handler

`...`
:   variable arguments

**Description**

This call allocates interrupt resources and enables the interrupt line and
IRQ handling. From the point this call is made **handler** and **thread_fn** may
be invoked. All interrupts requested using this function might be shared.

**dev_id** must not be NULL and must be globally unique.

void pci_free_irq(struct pci_dev \*dev, unsigned int nr, void \*dev_id)

**Description**

Remove an interrupt handler. The handler is removed and if the interrupt
line is no longer in use by any driver it is disabled. The caller must
ensure the interrupt is disabled on the device before calling this function.

have completed.

This function must not be called from interrupt context.

struct pci_slot \*pci_create_slot(struct pci_bus \*parent, int slot_nr, const char \*name, struct hotplug_slot \*hotplug)
:   create or increment refcount for physical PCI slot

**Parameters**

`struct pci_bus *parent`
:   struct pci_bus of parent bridge

`int slot_nr`
:   PCI_SLOT(pci_dev->devfn) or -1 for placeholder

`const char *name`
:   user visible string presented in /sys/bus/pci/slots/<name>

`struct hotplug_slot *hotplug`
:   set if caller is hotplug driver, NULL otherwise

**Description**

PCI slots have first class attributes such as address, speed, width,
and a `struct pci_slot` is used to manage them. This interface will
either return a new `struct pci_slot` to the caller, or if the pci_slot
already exists, its refcount will be incremented.

Slots are uniquely identified by a **pci_bus**, **slot_nr** tuple.

There are known platforms with broken firmware that assign the same
name to multiple slots. Workaround these broken platforms by renaming
the slots on behalf of the caller. If firmware assigns name N to
multiple slots:

The first slot is assigned N
The second slot is assigned N-1
The third slot is assigned N-2
etc.

Placeholder slots:
In most cases, **pci_bus**, **slot_nr** will be sufficient to uniquely identify
a slot. There is one notable exception - pSeries (rpaphp), where the
**slot_nr** cannot be determined until a device is actually inserted into
the slot. In this scenario, the caller may pass -1 for **slot_nr**.

The following semantics are imposed when the caller passes **slot_nr** ==
-1. First, we no longer check for an existing `struct` pci_slot, as there
may be many slots with **slot_nr** of -1. The other change in semantics is
user-visible, which is the 'address' parameter presented in sysfs will
consist solely of a dddd:bb tuple, where dddd is the PCI domain of the
`struct` pci_bus and bb is the bus number. In other words, the devfn of
the 'placeholder' slot will not be displayed.

void pci_destroy_slot(struct pci_slot \*slot)
:   decrement refcount for physical PCI slot

**Parameters**

`struct pci_slot *slot`
:   struct pci_slot to decrement

**Description**

just call kobject_put on its kobj and let our release methods do the
rest.

[`pci_enable_sriov()`](pci.md#c.pci_enable_sriov "pci_enable_sriov") is called and [`pci_disable_sriov()`](pci.md#c.pci_disable_sriov "pci_disable_sriov") does not return until
all VF drivers have completed their remove().

The PF driver must call [`pci_disable_sriov()`](pci.md#c.pci_disable_sriov "pci_disable_sriov") before it begins to destroy the
drvdata.

separately by invoking pci_hp_initialize() and [`pci_hp_add()`](pci.md#c.pci_hp_add "pci_hp_add").

Returns 0 if successful, anything else for an error.

int __pci_hp_initialize(struct hotplug_slot \*slot, struct pci_bus \*bus, int devnr, const char \*name, struct module \*owner, const char \*mod_name)
