# I2C and SMBus Subsystem

I2C (or without fancy typography, "I2C") is an acronym for
the "Inter-IC" bus, a simple bus protocol which is widely used where low
data rate communications suffice. Since it's also a licensed trademark,
some vendors use another name (such as "Two-Wire Interface", TWI) for
the same bus. I2C only needs two signals (SCL for clock, SDA for data),
conserving board real estate and minimizing signal quality issues. Most
I2C devices use seven bit addresses, and bus speeds of up to 400 kHz;
there's a high speed extension (3.4 MHz) that's not yet found wide use.
I2C is a multi-master bus; open drain signaling is used to arbitrate
between masters, as well as to handshake and to synchronize clocks from
slower clients.

The Linux I2C programming interfaces support the master side of bus
interactions and the slave side. The programming interface is
structured around two kinds of driver, and two kinds of device. An I2C
"Adapter Driver" abstracts the controller hardware; it binds to a
physical device (perhaps a PCI device or platform_device) and exposes a
`struct i2c_adapter` representing each
I2C bus segment it manages. On each I2C bus segment will be I2C devices
represented by a [`struct i2c_client`](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client").
Those devices will be bound to a [`struct i2c_driver`](i2c.md#c.i2c_driver "i2c_driver"), which should follow the standard Linux driver model. There
are functions to perform various I2C protocol operations; at this writing
all such functions are usable only from task context.

The System Management Bus (SMBus) is a sibling protocol. Most SMBus
systems are also I2C conformant. The electrical constraints are tighter
for SMBus, and it standardizes particular protocol messages and idioms.
Controllers that support I2C can also support most SMBus operations, but
SMBus controllers don't support all the protocol options that an I2C
controller will. There are functions to perform various SMBus protocol
operations, either using I2C primitives or by issuing SMBus commands to
i2c_adapter devices which don't support those I2C operations.

enum i2c_driver_flags
:   Flags for an I2C device driver

**Constants**

`I2C_DRV_ACPI_WAIVE_D0_PROBE`
:   Don't put the device in D0 state for probe

struct i2c_driver
:   represent an I2C device driver

**Definition**:

```
struct i2c_driver {
    unsigned int class;
    int (*probe)(struct i2c_client *client);
    void (*remove)(struct i2c_client *client);
    void (*shutdown)(struct i2c_client *client);

    const unsigned short *address_list;
    struct list_head clients;
    u32 flags;
};
```

**Members**

`class`
:   What kind of i2c device we instantiate (for detect)

`probe`
:   Callback for device binding

`remove`
:   Callback for device unbinding

`shutdown`
:   Callback for device shutdown

`alert`
:   Alert callback, for example for the SMBus alert protocol

`command`
:   Callback for bus-wide signaling (optional)

`driver`
:   Device driver model driver

`id_table`
:   List of I2C devices supported by this driver

`detect`
:   Callback for device detection

`address_list`
:   The I2C addresses to probe (for detect)

`clients`
:   List of detected clients we created (for i2c-core use only)

`flags`
:   A bitmask of flags defined in [`enum i2c_driver_flags`](i2c.md#c.i2c_driver_flags "i2c_driver_flags")

**Description**

The driver.owner field should be set to the module owner of this driver.
The driver.name field should be set to the name of this driver.

For automatic device detection, both **detect** and **address_list** must
be defined. **class** should also be set, otherwise only devices forced
with module parameters will be created. The detect function must
fill at least the name field of the i2c_board_info structure it is
handed upon successful detection, and possibly also the flags field.

If **detect** is missing, the driver will still work fine for enumerated
devices. Detected devices simply won't be supported. This is expected
for the many I2C/SMBus devices which can't be detected reliably, and
the ones which can always be enumerated in practice.

The i2c_client structure which is handed to the **detect** callback is
not a real i2c_client. It is initialized just enough so that you can
call i2c_smbus_read_byte_data and friends on it. Don't do anything
else with it. In particular, calling dev_dbg and friends on it is
not allowed.

struct i2c_client
:   represent an I2C slave device

struct i2c_client {
    unsigned short flags;

#define I2C_CLIENT_HOST_NOTIFY  0x40    ;
#define I2C_CLIENT_WAKE         0x80    ;
#define I2C_CLIENT_SCCB         0x9000  ;

#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_I2C_SLAVE);
    i2c_slave_cb_t slave_cb;

:   Address used on the I2C bus connected to the parent adapter.

`name`
:   Indicates the type of the device, usually a chip name that's
    generic enough to hide second-sourcing and compatible revisions.

`adapter`
:   manages the bus segment hosting this I2C device

`dev`
:   Driver model device node for the slave.

`init_irq`
:   IRQ that was set at initialization

i2c bus. The behaviour exposed to Linux is defined by the driver
managing the device.

struct i2c_board_info
:   template for device creation

**Definition**:

```
struct i2c_board_info {
    char type[I2C_NAME_SIZE];
    unsigned short  flags;
    unsigned short  addr;
    const char      *dev_name;
    void *platform_data;
    struct device_node *of_node;
    struct fwnode_handle *fwnode;
    const struct software_node *swnode;
    const struct resource *resources;
    unsigned int    num_resources;
    int irq;
};
```

**Members**

`type`
:   chip type, to initialize i2c_client.name

`flags`
:   to initialize i2c_client.flags

`addr`
:   stored in i2c_client.addr

`dev_name`
:   Overrides the default <busnr>-<addr> dev_name if set

`platform_data`
:   stored in i2c_client.dev.platform_data

`of_node`
:   pointer to OpenFirmware device node

`fwnode`
:   device node supplied by the platform firmware

`swnode`
:   software node for the device

`resources`
:   resources associated with the device

`num_resources`
:   number of resources in the **resources** array

`irq`
:   stored in i2c_client.irq

**Description**

I2C doesn't actually support hardware probing, although controllers and
devices may be able to use I2C_SMBUS_QUICK to tell whether or not there's
a device at a given address. Drivers commonly need more information than
that, such as chip type, configuration, associated IRQ, and so on.

i2c_board_info is used to build tables of information listing I2C devices
that are present. This information is used to grow the driver model tree.
For mainboards this is done statically using [`i2c_register_board_info()`](i2c.md#c.i2c_register_board_info "i2c_register_board_info");
bus numbers identify adapters that aren't yet available. For add-on boards,
[`i2c_new_client_device()`](i2c.md#c.i2c_new_client_device "i2c_new_client_device") does this dynamically with the adapter already known.

I2C_BOARD_INFO

**Description**

This macro initializes essential fields of a [`struct i2c_board_info`](i2c.md#c.i2c_board_info "i2c_board_info"),
declaring what has been provided on a particular board. Optional
fields (such as associated irq, or device-specific platform_data)
are provided using conventional syntax.

    defined by the msgs array, with num messages available to transfer via
    the adapter specified by adap.

    so e.g. PMICs can be accessed very late before shutdown. Optional.

`smbus_xfer`
:   Issue smbus transactions to the given I2C adapter. If this
    is not present, then the bus layer will try and convert the SMBus calls
    into I2C transfers instead.

`smbus_xfer_atomic`
:   same as **smbus_xfer**. Yet, only using atomic context
    so e.g. PMICs can be accessed very late before shutdown. Optional.

`functionality`
:   Return the flags that this algorithm/adapter pair supports
    from the `I2C_FUNC_*` flags.

`reg_slave`
:   Register given client to I2C slave mode of this adapter

`unreg_slave`
:   Unregister given client from I2C slave mode of this adapter

**Description**

The following structs are for those who like to implement new bus drivers:
i2c_algorithm is the interface to a class of hardware solutions which can
be addressed using the same bus algorithms - i.e. bit-banging or the PCF8584
to name two of the most common.

The return codes from the `master_xfer{_atomic}` fields should indicate the
type of error code that occurred during the transfer, as documented in the
Kernel Documentation file [I2C/SMBUS Fault Codes](../i2c/fault-codes.md). Otherwise, the
number of messages executed should be returned.

    int max_num_msgs;
    u16 max_write_len;
    u16 max_read_len;
    u16 max_comb_1st_msg_len;
    u16 max_comb_2nd_msg_len;
};
```

**Members**

`flags`
:   see I2C_AQ_\* for possible flags and read below

`max_num_msgs`
:   maximum number of messages per transfer

`max_write_len`
:   maximum length of a write message

`max_read_len`
:   maximum length of a read message

`max_comb_1st_msg_len`
:   maximum length of the first msg in a combined message

`max_comb_2nd_msg_len`
:   maximum length of the second msg in a combined message

**Description**

Note about combined messages: Some I2C controllers can only send one message
per transfer, plus something called combined message or write-then-read.
This is (usually) a small write message followed by a read message and
barely enough to access register based devices like EEPROMs. There is a flag
to support this mode. It implies max_num_msg = 2 and does the length checks
with max_comb_\*_len because combined message mode usually has its own
limitations. Because of HW implementations, some controllers can actually do
write-then-anything or other variants. To support that, write-then-read has
been broken out into smaller bits like write-first and read-second which can
be combined as needed.

void i2c_lock_bus(struct i2c_adapter \*adapter, unsigned int flags)
:   Get exclusive access to an I2C bus segment

**Parameters**

`unsigned int flags`
:   I2C_LOCK_ROOT_ADAPTER tries to locks the root i2c adapter,
    I2C_LOCK_SEGMENT tries to lock only this branch in the adapter tree

**Return**

void i2c_unlock_bus(struct i2c_adapter \*adapter, unsigned int flags)
:   Release exclusive access to an I2C bus segment

**Parameters**

`struct i2c_adapter *adapter`

**Description**

When using this helper to mark an adapter as suspended, the core will reject
further transfers to this adapter. The usage of this helper is optional but
recommended for devices having distinct handlers for system suspend and
runtime suspend. More complex devices are free to implement custom solutions
to reject transfers when suspended.

:   i2c_driver struct

**Description**

Helper macro for I2C drivers which do not do anything special in their
init. This eliminates a lot of boilerplate. Each driver may only
use this macro once, and calling it replaces device_initcall().

int i2c_register_board_info(int busnum, struct [i2c_board_info](i2c.md#c.i2c_board_info "i2c_board_info") const \*info, unsigned len)
:   statically declare I2C devices

**Parameters**

`int busnum`
:   identifies the bus to which these devices belong

`struct i2c_board_info const *info`
:   vector of i2c device descriptors

`unsigned len`
:   how many descriptors in the vector; may be zero to reserve
    the specified bus number.

**Description**

Systems using the Linux I2C driver stack can declare tables of board info
while they initialize. This should be done in board-specific init code
near arch_initcall() time, or equivalent, before any I2C adapter driver is
registered. For example, mainboard init code could define several devices,
as could the init code for each daughtercard in a board stack.

The I2C devices will be created later, after the adapter for the relevant
bus has been registered. After that moment, standard driver model tools
are used to bind "new style" I2C drivers to the devices. The bus number
for any device declared using this routine is not available for dynamic
allocation.

The board info passed can safely be __initdata, but be careful of embedded
pointers (for platform_data, functions, etc) since that won't be copied.

struct [i2c_client](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") \*i2c_verify_client(struct [device](infrastructure.md#c.device "device") \*dev)
:   return parameter as i2c_client, or NULL

**Parameters**

`struct device *dev`
:   device, probably from some driver model iterator

**Description**

When traversing the driver model tree, perhaps using driver model
iterators like **[`device_for_each_child()`](infrastructure.md#c.device_for_each_child "device_for_each_child")**, you can't assume very much
about the nodes you find. Use this function to avoid oopses caused
by wrongly treating some non-I2C device as an i2c_client.

struct [i2c_client](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") \*i2c_new_client_device(struct i2c_adapter \*adap, struct [i2c_board_info](i2c.md#c.i2c_board_info "i2c_board_info") const \*info)
:   instantiate an i2c device

**Parameters**

`struct i2c_adapter *adap`
:   the adapter managing the device

`struct i2c_board_info const *info`
:   describes one I2C device; bus_num is ignored

**Context**

can sleep

**Description**

Create an i2c device. Binding is handled through driver model
probe()/remove() methods. A driver may be bound to this device when we
return from this function, or any later moment (e.g. maybe hotplugging will
load the driver module). This call is not appropriate for use by mainboard
initialization logic, which usually runs during an arch_initcall() long
before any i2c_adapter could exist.

This returns the new i2c client, which may be saved for later use with
[`i2c_unregister_device()`](i2c.md#c.i2c_unregister_device "i2c_unregister_device"); or an ERR_PTR to describe the error.

void i2c_unregister_device(struct [i2c_client](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") \*client)
:   reverse effect of i2c_new_\*_device()

**Parameters**

`struct i2c_client *client`
:   value returned from i2c_new_\*_device()

**Context**

can sleep

struct [i2c_client](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") \*i2c_find_device_by_fwnode(struct fwnode_handle \*fwnode)
:   find an i2c_client for the fwnode

**Parameters**

`struct fwnode_handle *fwnode`
:   `struct fwnode_handle` corresponding to the [`struct i2c_client`](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client")

**Description**

Look up and return the [`struct i2c_client`](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") corresponding to the **fwnode**.
If no client can be found, or **fwnode** is NULL, this returns NULL.

The user must call put_device(`client->dev`) once done with the i2c client.

struct [i2c_client](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") \*i2c_new_dummy_device(struct i2c_adapter \*adapter, u16 address)
:   return a new i2c device bound to a dummy driver

**Parameters**

`struct i2c_adapter *adapter`
:   the adapter managing the device

`u16 address`
:   seven bit address to be used

**Context**

can sleep

**Description**

This returns an I2C client bound to the "dummy" driver, intended for use
with devices that consume multiple addresses. Examples of such chips
include various EEPROMS (like 24c04 and 24c08 models).

These dummy devices have two main uses. First, most I2C and SMBus calls
except [`i2c_transfer()`](i2c.md#c.i2c_transfer "i2c_transfer") need a client handle; the dummy will be that handle.
And second, this prevents the specified address from being bound to a
different driver.

This returns the new i2c client, which should be saved for later use with
[`i2c_unregister_device()`](i2c.md#c.i2c_unregister_device "i2c_unregister_device"); or an ERR_PTR to describe the error.

struct [i2c_client](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") \*devm_i2c_new_dummy_device(struct [device](infrastructure.md#c.device "device") \*dev, struct i2c_adapter \*adapter, u16 address)
:   return a new i2c device bound to a dummy driver

**Parameters**

`struct device *dev`
:   device the managed resource is bound to

`struct i2c_adapter *adapter`
:   the adapter managing the device

`u16 address`
:   seven bit address to be used

**Context**

can sleep

**Description**

This is the device-managed version of **i2c_new_dummy_device**. It returns the
new i2c client or an ERR_PTR in case of an error.

struct [i2c_client](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") \*i2c_new_ancillary_device(struct [i2c_client](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") \*client, const char \*name, u16 default_addr)
:   Helper to get the instantiated secondary address and create the associated device

**Parameters**

`struct i2c_client *client`
:   Handle to the primary client

`const char *name`
:   Handle to specify which secondary address to get

`u16 default_addr`
:   Used as a fallback if no secondary address was specified

**Context**

can sleep

**Description**

I2C clients can be composed of multiple I2C slaves bound together in a single
component. The I2C client driver then binds to the master I2C slave and needs
to create I2C dummy clients to communicate with all the other slaves.

This function creates and returns an I2C dummy client whose I2C address is
retrieved from the platform firmware based on the given slave name. If no
address is specified by the firmware default_addr is used.

On DT-based platforms the address is retrieved from the "reg" property entry
cell whose "reg-names" value matches the slave name.

This returns the new i2c client, which should be saved for later use with
[`i2c_unregister_device()`](i2c.md#c.i2c_unregister_device "i2c_unregister_device"); or an ERR_PTR to describe the error.

struct i2c_adapter \*i2c_verify_adapter(struct [device](infrastructure.md#c.device "device") \*dev)
:   return parameter as i2c_adapter or NULL

**Parameters**

`struct device *dev`
:   device, probably from some driver model iterator

**Description**

When traversing the driver model tree, perhaps using driver model
iterators like **[`device_for_each_child()`](infrastructure.md#c.device_for_each_child "device_for_each_child")**, you can't assume very much
about the nodes you find. Use this function to avoid oopses caused
by wrongly treating some non-I2C device as an i2c_adapter.

int i2c_handle_smbus_host_notify(struct i2c_adapter \*adap, unsigned short addr)
:   Forward a Host Notify event to the correct I2C client.

**Parameters**

`struct i2c_adapter *adap`
:   the adapter

`unsigned short addr`
:   the I2C address of the notifying device

**Context**

can't sleep

**Description**

Helper function to be called from an I2C bus driver's interrupt
handler. It will schedule the Host Notify IRQ.

int i2c_add_adapter(struct i2c_adapter \*adapter)
:   declare i2c adapter, use dynamic bus number

**Parameters**

`struct i2c_adapter *adapter`
:   the adapter to add

**Context**

can sleep

**Description**

This routine is used to declare an I2C adapter when its bus number
doesn't matter or when its bus number is specified by an dt alias.
Examples of bases when the bus number doesn't matter: I2C adapters
dynamically added by USB links or PCI plugin cards.

When this returns zero, a new bus number was allocated and stored
in adap->nr, and the specified adapter became available for clients.
Otherwise, a negative errno value is returned.

int i2c_add_numbered_adapter(struct i2c_adapter \*adap)
:   declare i2c adapter, use static bus number

**Parameters**

`struct i2c_adapter *adap`
:   the adapter to register (with adap->nr initialized)

**Context**

can sleep

**Description**

This routine is used to declare an I2C adapter when its bus number
matters. For example, use it for I2C adapters from system-on-chip CPUs,
or otherwise built in to the system's mainboard, and where i2c_board_info
is used to properly configure I2C devices.

If the requested bus number is set to -1, then this function will behave
identically to i2c_add_adapter, and will dynamically assign a bus number.

If no devices have pre-been declared for this bus, then be sure to
register the adapter before any dynamically allocated ones. Otherwise
the required bus ID may not be available.

When this returns zero, the specified adapter became available for
clients using the bus number provided in adap->nr. Also, the table
of I2C devices pre-declared using [`i2c_register_board_info()`](i2c.md#c.i2c_register_board_info "i2c_register_board_info") is scanned,
and the appropriate driver model device nodes are created. Otherwise, a
negative errno value is returned.

void i2c_del_adapter(struct i2c_adapter \*adap)
:   unregister I2C adapter

**Parameters**

`struct i2c_adapter *adap`
:   the adapter being unregistered

**Context**

can sleep

**Description**

This unregisters an I2C adapter which was previously registered
by **i2c_add_adapter** or **i2c_add_numbered_adapter**.

:   device-managed variant of [`i2c_add_adapter()`](i2c.md#c.i2c_add_adapter "i2c_add_adapter")

**Parameters**

`struct device *dev`
:   managing device for adding this I2C adapter

`struct i2c_adapter *adapter`
:   the adapter to add

**Context**

can sleep

**Description**

Add adapter with dynamic bus number, same with [`i2c_add_adapter()`](i2c.md#c.i2c_add_adapter "i2c_add_adapter")
but the adapter will be auto deleted on driver detach.

struct i2c_adapter \*i2c_find_adapter_by_fwnode(struct fwnode_handle \*fwnode)
:   find an i2c_adapter for the fwnode

**Parameters**

`struct fwnode_handle *fwnode`
:   `struct fwnode_handle` corresponding to the `struct i2c_adapter`

**Description**

Look up and return the `struct i2c_adapter` corresponding to the **fwnode**.
If no adapter can be found, or **fwnode** is NULL, this returns NULL.

The user must call put_device(`adapter->dev`) once done with the i2c adapter.

struct i2c_adapter \*i2c_get_adapter_by_fwnode(struct fwnode_handle \*fwnode)
:   find an i2c_adapter for the fwnode

**Parameters**

`struct fwnode_handle *fwnode`
:   `struct fwnode_handle` corresponding to the `struct i2c_adapter`

**Description**

Look up and return the `struct i2c_adapter` corresponding to the **fwnode**,
and increment the adapter module's use count. If no adapter can be found,
or **fwnode** is NULL, this returns NULL.

The user must call i2c_put_adapter(adapter) once done with the i2c adapter.
Note that this is different from i2c_find_adapter_by_node().

void i2c_parse_fw_timings(struct [device](infrastructure.md#c.device "device") \*dev, struct [i2c_timings](i2c.md#c.i2c_timings "i2c_timings") \*t, bool use_defaults)
:   get I2C related timing parameters from firmware

**Parameters**

`struct device *dev`
:   The device to scan for I2C timing properties

`struct i2c_timings *t`
:   the i2c_timings struct to be filled with values

`bool use_defaults`
:   bool to use sane defaults derived from the I2C specification
    when properties are not found, otherwise don't update

**Description**

Scan the device for the generic I2C properties describing timing parameters
for the signal and fill the given struct with the results. If a property was
not found and use_defaults was true, then maximum timings are assumed which
are derived from the I2C specification. If use_defaults is not used, the
results will be as before, so drivers can apply their own defaults before
calling this helper. The latter is mainly intended for avoiding regressions
of existing drivers which want to switch to this function. New drivers
almost always should use the defaults.

void i2c_del_driver(struct [i2c_driver](i2c.md#c.i2c_driver "i2c_driver") \*driver)
:   unregister I2C driver

**Parameters**

`struct i2c_driver *driver`

:   execute a single or combined I2C message

**Parameters**

`struct i2c_adapter *adap`

:   One or more messages to execute before STOP is issued to
    terminate the operation; each message begins with a START.

`int num`
:   Number of messages to be executed.

**Description**

Returns negative errno, else the number of messages executed.

Note that there is no requirement that each message be sent to
the same slave address, although that is the most common model.

int i2c_transfer_buffer_flags(const struct [i2c_client](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") \*client, char \*buf, int count, u16 flags)
:   issue a single I2C message transferring data to/from a buffer

**Description**

Returns negative errno on error, zero on success.

const struct i2c_device_id \*i2c_client_get_device_id(const struct [i2c_client](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") \*client)
:   get the driver match table entry of a device

**Parameters**

`const struct i2c_client *client`
:   the device to query. The device must be bound to a driver

    calling [`i2c_put_dma_safe_msg_buf()`](i2c.md#c.i2c_put_dma_safe_msg_buf "i2c_put_dma_safe_msg_buf").

**Description**

This function must only be called from process context!

:   the buffer obtained from [`i2c_get_dma_safe_msg_buf()`](i2c.md#c.i2c_get_dma_safe_msg_buf "i2c_get_dma_safe_msg_buf"). May be NULL.

`struct i2c_msg *msg`
:   the message which the buffer corresponds to

This executes the SMBus "receive byte" protocol, returning negative errno
else the byte received from the device.

s32 i2c_smbus_write_byte(const struct [i2c_client](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") \*client, u8 value)
:   SMBus "send byte" protocol

**Parameters**

`const struct i2c_client *client`
:   Handle to slave device

else a data byte received from the device.

s32 i2c_smbus_write_byte_data(const struct [i2c_client](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") \*client, u8 command, u8 value)
:   SMBus "write byte" protocol

**Parameters**

`const struct i2c_client *client`
:   Handle to slave device

`u8 command`
:   Byte interpreted by slave

`u8 value`
:   Byte being written

**Description**

This executes the SMBus "write byte" protocol, returning negative errno

:   SMBus "block read" protocol

**Parameters**

`const struct i2c_client *client`
:   Handle to slave device

`u8 command`
:   Byte interpreted by slave

`u8 *values`
:   Byte array into which data will be read; big enough to hold
    the data returned by the slave. SMBus allows at most 32 bytes.

**Description**

This executes the SMBus "block read" protocol, returning negative errno
else the number of data bytes in the slave's response.

Note that using this function requires that the client's adapter support
the I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_BLOCK_DATA functionality. Not all adapter drivers
support this; its emulation through I2C messaging relies on a specific
mechanism (I2C_M_RECV_LEN) which may not be implemented.

s32 i2c_smbus_write_block_data(const struct [i2c_client](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") \*client, u8 command, u8 length, const u8 \*values)

else zero on success.

s32 i2c_smbus_xfer(struct i2c_adapter \*adapter, u16 addr, unsigned short flags, char read_write, u8 command, int protocol, union i2c_smbus_data \*data)
:   execute SMBus protocol operations

    I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX bytes.

**Description**

This executes the SMBus "block read" protocol if supported by the adapter.
If block read is not supported, it emulates it using either word or byte
read protocols depending on availability.

The addresses of the I2C slave device that are accessed with this function
must be mapped to a linear region, so that a block read will have the same
effect as a byte read. Before using this function you must double-check
if the I2C slave does support exchanging a block transfer with a byte
transfer.

struct [i2c_client](i2c.md#c.i2c_client "i2c_client") \*i2c_new_smbus_alert_device(struct i2c_adapter \*adapter, struct i2c_smbus_alert_setup \*setup)
:   get ara client for SMBus alert support

**Parameters**

`struct i2c_adapter *adapter`
:   the target adapter

`struct i2c_smbus_alert_setup *setup`
:   setup data for the SMBus alert handler

**Context**

can sleep

**Description**

Setup handling of the SMBus alert protocol on a given I2C bus segment.

Handling can be done either through our IRQ handler, or by the
adapter (from its handler, periodic polling, or whatever).

This returns the ara client, which should be saved for later use with
i2c_handle_smbus_alert() and ultimately [`i2c_unregister_device()`](i2c.md#c.i2c_unregister_device "i2c_unregister_device"); or an
ERRPTR to indicate an error.
