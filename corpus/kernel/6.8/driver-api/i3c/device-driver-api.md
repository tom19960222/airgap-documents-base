# I3C device driver API

enum i3c_error_code
:   I3C error codes

**Constants**

`I3C_ERROR_UNKNOWN`
:   unknown error, usually means the error is not I3C

**Description**

These are the standard error codes as defined by the I3C specification.
When -EIO is returned by the [`i3c_device_do_priv_xfers()`](device-driver-api.md#c.i3c_device_do_priv_xfers "i3c_device_do_priv_xfers") or
i3c_device_send_hdr_cmds() one can check the error code in
`struct_i3c_priv_xfer.err` or `struct i3c_hdr_cmd`.err to get a better idea of
what went wrong.

[`i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked()`](master-driver-api.md#c.i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked "i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked"), the core will send the relevant CCC command
to retrieve these data.

struct i3c_driver {
    struct device_driver driver;
    int (*probe)(struct i3c_device *dev);

**Parameters**

`__drv`
:   the I3C driver to register

**Description**

Provide generic init/exit functions that simply register/unregister an I3C
driver.
Should be used by any driver that does not require extra init/cleanup steps.

int i3c_i2c_driver_register(struct [i3c_driver](device-driver-api.md#c.i3c_driver "i3c_driver") \*i3cdrv, struct [i2c_driver](../i2c.md#c.i2c_driver "i2c_driver") \*i2cdrv)

:   the I3C driver to register

`struct i2c_driver *i2cdrv`
:   the I2C driver to register

**Description**

This function registers both **i2cdev** and **i3cdev**, and fails if one of these
registrations fails. This is mainly useful for devices that support both I2C
and I3C modes.
Note that when CONFIG_I3C is not enabled, this function only registers the
I2C driver.

**Return**

0 if both registrations succeeds, a negative error code otherwise.

void i3c_i2c_driver_unregister(struct [i3c_driver](device-driver-api.md#c.i3c_driver "i3c_driver") \*i3cdrv, struct [i2c_driver](../i2c.md#c.i2c_driver "i2c_driver") \*i2cdrv)
:   Unregister an i2c and an i3c driver

**Parameters**

`struct i3c_driver *i3cdrv`
:   the I3C driver to register

`struct i2c_driver *i2cdrv`
:   the I2C driver to register

**Description**

This function unregisters both **i3cdrv** and **i2cdrv**.
Note that when CONFIG_I3C is not enabled, this function only unregisters the
**i2cdrv**.

module_i3c_i2c_driver

`module_i3c_i2c_driver (__i3cdrv, __i2cdrv)`

> Register a module providing an I3C and an I2C driver

**Parameters**

`__i3cdrv`
:   the I3C driver to register

`__i2cdrv`
:   the I3C driver to register

**Description**

Provide generic init/exit functions that simply register/unregister an I3C
and an I2C driver.
This macro can be used even if CONFIG_I3C is disabled, in this case, only
the I2C driver will be registered.
Should be used by any driver that does not require extra init/cleanup steps.

struct i3c_ibi_setup
:   IBI setup object

**Definition**:

```
struct i3c_ibi_setup {
    unsigned int max_payload_len;
    unsigned int num_slots;
    void (*handler)(struct i3c_device *dev, const struct i3c_ibi_payload *payload);
};
```

**Members**

`max_payload_len`
:   maximum length of the payload associated to an IBI. If one
    IBI appears to have a payload that is bigger than this
    number, the IBI will be rejected.

`num_slots`
:   number of pre-allocated IBI slots. This should be chosen so that
    the system never runs out of IBI slots, otherwise you'll lose
    IBIs.

`handler`
:   IBI handler, every time an IBI is received. This handler is called
    in a workqueue context. It is allowed to sleep and send new
    messages on the bus, though it's recommended to keep the
    processing done there as fast as possible to avoid delaying
    processing of other queued on the same workqueue.

**Description**

Temporary structure used to pass information to [`i3c_device_request_ibi()`](device-driver-api.md#c.i3c_device_request_ibi "i3c_device_request_ibi").
This object can be allocated on the stack since [`i3c_device_request_ibi()`](device-driver-api.md#c.i3c_device_request_ibi "i3c_device_request_ibi")
copies every bit of information and do not use it after
[`i3c_device_request_ibi()`](device-driver-api.md#c.i3c_device_request_ibi "i3c_device_request_ibi") has returned.

int i3c_device_do_priv_xfers(struct [i3c_device](master-driver-api.md#c.i3c_device "i3c_device") \*dev, struct [i3c_priv_xfer](device-driver-api.md#c.i3c_priv_xfer "i3c_priv_xfer") \*xfers, int nxfers)

**Parameters**

`struct i3c_device *dev`
:   device with which the transfers should be done

`struct i3c_priv_xfer *xfers`
:   array of transfers

`int nxfers`
:   number of transfers

**Description**

Initiate one or several private SDR transfers with **dev**.

This function can sleep and thus cannot be called in atomic context.

**Return**

0 in case of success, a negative error core otherwise.

int i3c_device_do_setdasa(struct [i3c_device](master-driver-api.md#c.i3c_device "i3c_device") \*dev)
:   do I3C dynamic address assignement with static address

**Parameters**

`struct i3c_device *dev`

:   Enable IBIs coming from a specific device

**Parameters**

`struct i3c_device *dev`
:   device on which IBIs should be enabled

**Description**

This function enable IBIs coming from a specific device and wait for
all pending IBIs to be processed. This should be called on a device
where [`i3c_device_request_ibi()`](device-driver-api.md#c.i3c_device_request_ibi "i3c_device_request_ibi") has succeeded.

Note that IBIs from this device might be received before this function
returns to its caller.

**Return**

**Parameters**

`struct i3c_device *dev`
:   device for which we should enable IBIs

`const struct i3c_ibi_setup *req`
:   setup requested for this IBI

**Description**

This function is responsible for pre-allocating all resources needed to
process IBIs coming from **dev**. When this function returns, the IBI is not
enabled until [`i3c_device_enable_ibi()`](device-driver-api.md#c.i3c_device_enable_ibi "i3c_device_enable_ibi") is called.

**Return**

0 in case of success, a negative error core otherwise.

void i3c_device_free_ibi(struct [i3c_device](master-driver-api.md#c.i3c_device "i3c_device") \*dev)

This function is responsible for de-allocating resources previously
allocated by [`i3c_device_request_ibi()`](device-driver-api.md#c.i3c_device_request_ibi "i3c_device_request_ibi"). It should be called after disabling
IBIs with [`i3c_device_disable_ibi()`](device-driver-api.md#c.i3c_device_disable_ibi "i3c_device_disable_ibi").
