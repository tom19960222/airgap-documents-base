## [Allocation](tty_driver.md#id1)

The first thing a driver needs to do is to allocate a [`struct tty_driver`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver"). This
is done by tty_alloc_driver() (or [`__tty_alloc_driver()`](tty_driver.md#c.__tty_alloc_driver "__tty_alloc_driver")). Next, the newly
allocated structure is filled with information. See [TTY Driver Reference](tty_driver.md#tty-driver-reference) at
the end of this document on what actually shall be filled in.

The allocation routines expect a number of devices the driver can handle at
most and flags. Flags are those starting `TTY_DRIVER_` listed and described
in [TTY Driver Flags](tty_driver.md#tty-driver-flags) below.

When the driver is about to be freed, [`tty_driver_kref_put()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver_kref_put "tty_driver_kref_put") is called on that.
It will decrements the reference count and if it reaches zero, the driver is
freed.

For reference, both allocation and deallocation functions are explained here in
detail:

struct [tty_driver](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") \*__tty_alloc_driver(unsigned int lines, struct module \*owner, unsigned long flags)
:   allocate tty driver

**Parameters**

`unsigned int lines`
:   count of lines this driver can handle at most

`struct module *owner`
:   module which is responsible for this driver

`unsigned long flags`
:   some of `TTY_DRIVER_` flags, will be set in driver->flags

**Description**

This should not be called directly, some of the provided macros should be
used instead. Use [`IS_ERR()`](../../core-api/kernel-api.md#c.IS_ERR "IS_ERR") and friends on **retval**.

void tty_driver_kref_put(struct [tty_driver](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") \*driver)
:   drop a reference to a tty driver

**Parameters**

`struct tty_driver *driver`
:   driver of which to drop the reference

**Description**

The final put will destroy and free up the driver.

### [TTY Driver Flags](tty_driver.md#id2)

Here comes the documentation of flags accepted by tty_alloc_driver() (or
[`__tty_alloc_driver()`](tty_driver.md#c.__tty_alloc_driver "__tty_alloc_driver")):

TTY_DRIVER_RESET_TERMIOS
:   Requests the tty layer to reset the termios setting when the last
    process has closed the device. Used for PTYs, in particular.

TTY_DRIVER_REAL_RAW
:   Indicates that the driver will guarantee not to set any special
    character handling flags if this is set for the tty:

    `(IGNBRK || (!BRKINT && !PARMRK)) && (IGNPAR || !INPCK)`

    That is, if there is no reason for the driver to
    send notifications of parity and break characters up to the line
    driver, it won't do so. This allows the line driver to optimize for
    this case if this flag is set. (Note that there is also a promise, if
    the above case is true, not to signal overruns, either.)

TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_DEV
:   The individual tty devices need to be registered with a call to
    [`tty_register_device()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_device "tty_register_device") when the device is found in the system and
    unregistered with a call to [`tty_unregister_device()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_unregister_device "tty_unregister_device") so the devices will
    be show up properly in sysfs. If not set, all [`tty_driver.num`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") entries
    will be created by the tty core in sysfs when [`tty_register_driver()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_driver "tty_register_driver") is
    called. This is to be used by drivers that have tty devices that can
    appear and disappear while the main tty driver is registered with the
    tty core.

TTY_DRIVER_DEVPTS_MEM
:   Don't use the standard arrays ([`tty_driver.ttys`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") and
    [`tty_driver.termios`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver")), instead use dynamic memory keyed through the
    devpts filesystem. This is only applicable to the PTY driver.

TTY_DRIVER_HARDWARE_BREAK
:   Hardware handles break signals. Pass the requested timeout to the
    [`tty_operations.break_ctl`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_operations "tty_operations") instead of using a simple on/off interface.

TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_ALLOC
:   Do not allocate structures which are needed per line for this driver
    ([`tty_driver.ports`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver")) as it would waste memory. The driver will take
    care. This is only applicable to the PTY driver.

TTY_DRIVER_UNNUMBERED_NODE
:   Do not create numbered `/dev` nodes. For example, create
    `/dev/ttyprintk` and not `/dev/ttyprintk0`. Applicable only when a
    driver for a single tty device is being allocated.

---

## [Registration](tty_driver.md#id3)

When a [`struct tty_driver`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") is allocated and filled in, it can be registered using
[`tty_register_driver()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_driver "tty_register_driver"). It is recommended to pass `TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_DEV` in
flags of tty_alloc_driver(). If it is not passed, *all* devices are also
registered during [`tty_register_driver()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_driver "tty_register_driver") and the following paragraph of
registering devices can be skipped for such drivers. However, the [`struct
tty_port`](tty_port.md#c.tty_port "tty_port") part in [Registering Devices](tty_driver.md#registering-devices) is still relevant there.

int tty_register_driver(struct [tty_driver](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") \*driver)
:   register a tty driver

**Parameters**

`struct tty_driver *driver`
:   driver to register

**Description**

Called by a tty driver to register itself.

void tty_unregister_driver(struct [tty_driver](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") \*driver)
:   unregister a tty driver

**Parameters**

`struct tty_driver *driver`
:   driver to unregister

**Description**

Called by a tty driver to unregister itself.

### [Registering Devices](tty_driver.md#id4)

Every TTY device shall be backed by a [`struct tty_port`](tty_port.md#c.tty_port "tty_port"). Usually, TTY drivers
embed tty_port into device's private structures. Further details about handling
tty_port can be found in [TTY Port](tty_port.md). The driver is also recommended to use
tty_port's reference counting by tty_port_get() and [`tty_port_put()`](tty_port.md#c.tty_port_put "tty_port_put"). The final
put is supposed to free the tty_port including the device's private struct.

Unless `TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_DEV` was passed as flags to tty_alloc_driver(),
TTY driver is supposed to register every device discovered in the system
(the latter is preferred). This is performed by [`tty_register_device()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_device "tty_register_device"). Or by
[`tty_register_device_attr()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_device_attr "tty_register_device_attr") if the driver wants to expose some information
through struct attribute_group. Both of them register `index`'th device and
upon return, the device can be opened. There are also preferred tty_port
variants described in [Linking Devices to Ports](tty_driver.md#linking-devices-to-ports) later. It is up to driver to
manage free indices and choosing the right one. The TTY layer only refuses to
register more devices than passed to tty_alloc_driver().

When the device is opened, the TTY layer allocates [`struct tty_struct`](tty_struct.md#c.tty_struct "tty_struct") and starts
calling operations from `tty_driver.ops`, see [TTY Operations
Reference](tty_driver.md#tty-operations-reference).

The registration routines are documented as follows:

struct [device](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_device "device") \*tty_register_device(struct [tty_driver](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") \*driver, unsigned index, struct [device](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_device "device") \*device)
:   register a tty device

**Parameters**

`struct tty_driver *driver`
:   the tty driver that describes the tty device

`unsigned index`
:   the index in the tty driver for this tty device

`struct device *device`
:   a [`struct device`](../infrastructure.md#c.device "device") that is associated with this tty device.
    This field is optional, if there is no known [`struct device`](../infrastructure.md#c.device "device")
    for this tty device it can be set to NULL safely.

**Description**

This call is required to be made to register an individual tty device
if the tty driver's flags have the `TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_DEV` bit set. If
that bit is not set, this function should not be called by a tty
driver.

Locking: ??

**Return**

A pointer to the [`struct device`](../infrastructure.md#c.device "device") for this tty device (or
ERR_PTR(-EFOO) on error).

struct [device](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_device_attr "device") \*tty_register_device_attr(struct [tty_driver](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") \*driver, unsigned index, struct [device](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_device_attr "device") \*device, void \*drvdata, const struct attribute_group \*\*attr_grp)
:   register a tty device

**Parameters**

`struct tty_driver *driver`
:   the tty driver that describes the tty device

`unsigned index`
:   the index in the tty driver for this tty device

`struct device *device`
:   a [`struct device`](../infrastructure.md#c.device "device") that is associated with this tty device.
    This field is optional, if there is no known [`struct device`](../infrastructure.md#c.device "device")
    for this tty device it can be set to `NULL` safely.

`void *drvdata`
:   Driver data to be set to device.

`const struct attribute_group **attr_grp`
:   Attribute group to be set on device.

**Description**

This call is required to be made to register an individual tty device if the
tty driver's flags have the `TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_DEV` bit set. If that bit is
not set, this function should not be called by a tty driver.

Locking: ??

**Return**

A pointer to the [`struct device`](../infrastructure.md#c.device "device") for this tty device (or
ERR_PTR(-EFOO) on error).

void tty_unregister_device(struct [tty_driver](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") \*driver, unsigned index)
:   unregister a tty device

**Parameters**

`struct tty_driver *driver`
:   the tty driver that describes the tty device

`unsigned index`
:   the index in the tty driver for this tty device

**Description**

If a tty device is registered with a call to [`tty_register_device()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_device "tty_register_device") then
this function must be called when the tty device is gone.

Locking: ??

---

### [Linking Devices to Ports](tty_driver.md#id5)

As stated earlier, every TTY device shall have a [`struct tty_port`](tty_port.md#c.tty_port "tty_port") assigned to
it. It must be known to the TTY layer at `tty_driver.ops.install()`
at latest. There are few helpers to *link* the two. Ideally, the driver uses
[`tty_port_register_device()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_port_register_device "tty_port_register_device") or [`tty_port_register_device_attr()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_port_register_device_attr "tty_port_register_device_attr") instead of
[`tty_register_device()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_device "tty_register_device") and [`tty_register_device_attr()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_device_attr "tty_register_device_attr") at the registration time.
This way, the driver needs not care about linking later on.

If that is not possible, the driver still can link the tty_port to a specific
index *before* the actual registration by [`tty_port_link_device()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_port_link_device "tty_port_link_device"). If it still
does not fit, [`tty_port_install()`](tty_port.md#c.tty_port_install "tty_port_install") can be used from the
`tty_driver.ops.install` hook as a last resort. The last one is
dedicated mostly for in-memory devices like PTY where tty_ports are allocated
on demand.

The linking routines are documented here:

void tty_port_link_device(struct [tty_port](tty_port.md#c.tty_port "tty_port") \*port, struct [tty_driver](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") \*driver, unsigned index)
:   link tty and tty_port

**Parameters**

`struct tty_port *port`
:   tty_port of the device

`struct tty_driver *driver`
:   tty_driver for this device

`unsigned index`
:   index of the tty

**Description**

Provide the tty layer with a link from a tty (specified by **index**) to a
tty_port (**port**). Use this only if neither [`tty_port_register_device()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_port_register_device "tty_port_register_device") nor
[`tty_port_install()`](tty_port.md#c.tty_port_install "tty_port_install") is used in the driver. If used, this has to be called
before [`tty_register_driver()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_driver "tty_register_driver").

struct [device](tty_driver.md#c.tty_port_register_device "device") \*tty_port_register_device(struct [tty_port](tty_port.md#c.tty_port "tty_port") \*port, struct [tty_driver](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") \*driver, unsigned index, struct [device](tty_driver.md#c.tty_port_register_device "device") \*device)
:   register tty device

**Parameters**

`struct tty_port *port`
:   tty_port of the device

`struct tty_driver *driver`
:   tty_driver for this device

`unsigned index`
:   index of the tty

`struct device *device`
:   parent if exists, otherwise NULL

**Description**

It is the same as [`tty_register_device()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_device "tty_register_device") except the provided **port** is linked
to a concrete tty specified by **index**. Use this or [`tty_port_install()`](tty_port.md#c.tty_port_install "tty_port_install") (or
both). Call [`tty_port_link_device()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_port_link_device "tty_port_link_device") as a last resort.

struct [device](tty_driver.md#c.tty_port_register_device_attr "device") \*tty_port_register_device_attr(struct [tty_port](tty_port.md#c.tty_port "tty_port") \*port, struct [tty_driver](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") \*driver, unsigned index, struct [device](tty_driver.md#c.tty_port_register_device_attr "device") \*device, void \*drvdata, const struct attribute_group \*\*attr_grp)
:   register tty device

**Parameters**

`struct tty_port *port`
:   tty_port of the device

`struct tty_driver *driver`
:   tty_driver for this device

`unsigned index`
:   index of the tty

`struct device *device`
:   parent if exists, otherwise NULL

`void *drvdata`
:   Driver data to be set to device.

`const struct attribute_group **attr_grp`
:   Attribute group to be set on device.

**Description**

It is the same as [`tty_register_device_attr()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_device_attr "tty_register_device_attr") except the provided **port** is
linked to a concrete tty specified by **index**. Use this or [`tty_port_install()`](tty_port.md#c.tty_port_install "tty_port_install")
(or both). Call [`tty_port_link_device()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_port_link_device "tty_port_link_device") as a last resort.

## [TTY Driver Reference](tty_driver.md#id6)

All members of [`struct tty_driver`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") are documented here. The required members are
noted at the end. [`struct tty_operations`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_operations "tty_operations") are documented next.

struct tty_driver
:   - driver for TTY devices

**Definition**:

```
struct tty_driver {
    struct kref kref;
    struct cdev **cdevs;
    struct module   *owner;
    const char      *driver_name;
    const char      *name;
    int name_base;
    int major;
    int minor_start;
    unsigned int    num;
    short type;
    short subtype;
    struct ktermios init_termios;
    unsigned long   flags;
    struct proc_dir_entry *proc_entry;
    struct tty_driver *other;
    struct tty_struct **ttys;
    struct tty_port **ports;
    struct ktermios **termios;
    void *driver_state;
    const struct tty_operations *ops;
    struct list_head tty_drivers;
};
```

**Members**

`kref`
:   reference counting. Reaching zero frees all the internals and the
    driver.

`cdevs`
:   allocated/registered character /dev devices

`owner`
:   modules owning this driver. Used drivers cannot be rmmod'ed.
    Automatically set by tty_alloc_driver().

`driver_name`
:   name of the driver used in /proc/tty

`name`
:   used for constructing /dev node name

`name_base`
:   used as a number base for constructing /dev node name

`major`
:   major /dev device number (zero for autoassignment)

`minor_start`
:   the first minor /dev device number

`num`
:   number of devices allocated

`type`
:   type of tty driver (`TTY_DRIVER_TYPE_`)

`subtype`
:   subtype of tty driver (`SYSTEM_TYPE_`, `PTY_TYPE_`, `SERIAL_TYPE_`)

`init_termios`
:   termios to set to each tty initially (e.g. `tty_std_termios`)

`flags`
:   tty driver flags (`TTY_DRIVER_`)

`proc_entry`
:   proc fs entry, used internally

`other`
:   driver of the linked tty; only used for the PTY driver

`ttys`
:   array of active [`struct tty_struct`](tty_struct.md#c.tty_struct "tty_struct"), set by [`tty_standard_install()`](tty_struct.md#c.tty_standard_install "tty_standard_install")

`ports`
:   array of [`struct tty_port`](tty_port.md#c.tty_port "tty_port"); can be set during initialization by
    [`tty_port_link_device()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_port_link_device "tty_port_link_device") and similar

`termios`
:   storage for termios at each TTY close for the next open

`driver_state`
:   pointer to driver's arbitrary data

`ops`
:   driver hooks for TTYs. Set them using tty_set_operations(). Use [`struct
    tty_port`](tty_port.md#c.tty_port "tty_port") helpers in them as much as possible.

`tty_drivers`
:   used internally to link tty_drivers together

**Description**

The usual handling of [`struct tty_driver`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver") is to allocate it by
tty_alloc_driver(), set up all the necessary members, and register it by
[`tty_register_driver()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_driver "tty_register_driver"). At last, the driver is torn down by calling
[`tty_unregister_driver()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_unregister_driver "tty_unregister_driver") followed by [`tty_driver_kref_put()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver_kref_put "tty_driver_kref_put").

The fields required to be set before calling [`tty_register_driver()`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_register_driver "tty_register_driver") include
**driver_name**, **name**, **type**, **subtype**, **init_termios**, and **ops**.

## [TTY Operations Reference](tty_driver.md#id7)

When a TTY is registered, these driver hooks can be invoked by the TTY layer:

struct tty_operations
:   - interface between driver and tty

**Definition**:

```
struct tty_operations {
    struct tty_struct * (*lookup)(struct tty_driver *driver, struct file *filp, int idx);
    int (*install)(struct tty_driver *driver, struct tty_struct *tty);

#ifdef CONFIG_CONSOLE_POLL;
    int (*poll_init)(struct tty_driver *driver, int line, char *options);
    int (*poll_get_char)(struct tty_driver *driver, int line);
    void (*poll_put_char)(struct tty_driver *driver, int line, char ch);
#endif;
    int (*proc_show)(struct seq_file *m, void *driver);
};
```

**Members**

`lookup`
:   `struct tty_struct *()(struct tty_driver *self, struct file *,
    int idx)`

    > Return the tty device corresponding to **idx**, `NULL` if there is not
    > one currently in use and an `ERR_PTR` value on error. Called under
    > `tty_mutex` (for now!)
    >
    > Optional method. Default behaviour is to use the **self->ttys** array.

`install`
:   `int ()(struct tty_driver *self, struct tty_struct *tty)`

    Install a new **tty** into the **self**'s internal tables. Used in
    conjunction with **lookup** and **remove** methods.

    Optional method. Default behaviour is to use the **self->ttys** array.

`remove`
:   `void ()(struct tty_driver *self, struct tty_struct *tty)`

    Remove a closed **tty** from the **self**'s internal tables. Used in
    conjunction with **lookup** and **remove** methods.

    Optional method. Default behaviour is to use the **self->ttys** array.

`open`
:   `int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, struct file *)`

    This routine is called when a particular **tty** device is opened. This
    routine is mandatory; if this routine is not filled in, the attempted
    open will fail with `ENODEV`.

    Required method. Called with tty lock held. May sleep.

`close`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty, struct file *)`

    This routine is called when a particular **tty** device is closed. At the
    point of return from this call the driver must make no further ldisc
    calls of any kind.

    Remark: called even if the corresponding **open()** failed.

    Required method. Called with tty lock held. May sleep.

`shutdown`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)`

    This routine is called under the tty lock when a particular **tty** device
    is closed for the last time. It executes before the **tty** resources
    are freed so may execute while another function holds a **tty** kref.

`cleanup`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)`

    This routine is called asynchronously when a particular **tty** device
    is closed for the last time freeing up the resources. This is
    actually the second part of shutdown for routines that might sleep.

`write`
:   `ssize_t ()(struct tty_struct *tty, const u8 *buf, size_t count)`

    This routine is called by the kernel to write a series (**count**) of
    characters (**buf**) to the **tty** device. The characters may come from
    user space or kernel space. This routine will return the
    number of characters actually accepted for writing.

    May occur in parallel in special cases. Because this includes panic
    paths drivers generally shouldn't try and do clever locking here.

    Optional: Required for writable devices. May not sleep.

`put_char`
:   `int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, u8 ch)`

    This routine is called by the kernel to write a single character **ch** to
    the **tty** device. If the kernel uses this routine, it must call the
    **flush_chars()** routine (if defined) when it is done stuffing characters
    into the driver. If there is no room in the queue, the character is
    ignored.

    Optional: Kernel will use the **write** method if not provided. Do not
    call this function directly, call [`tty_put_char()`](tty_struct.md#c.tty_put_char "tty_put_char").

`flush_chars`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)`

    This routine is called by the kernel after it has written a
    series of characters to the tty device using **put_char()**.

    Optional. Do not call this function directly, call
    tty_driver_flush_chars().

`write_room`
:   `unsigned int ()(struct tty_struct *tty)`

    This routine returns the numbers of characters the **tty** driver
    will accept for queuing to be written. This number is subject
    to change as output buffers get emptied, or if the output flow
    control is acted.

    The ldisc is responsible for being intelligent about multi-threading of
    write_room/write calls

    Required if **write** method is provided else not needed. Do not call this
    function directly, call [`tty_write_room()`](tty_ioctl.md#c.tty_write_room "tty_write_room")

`chars_in_buffer`
:   `unsigned int ()(struct tty_struct *tty)`

    This routine returns the number of characters in the device private
    output queue. Used in [`tty_wait_until_sent()`](tty_ioctl.md#c.tty_wait_until_sent "tty_wait_until_sent") and for poll()
    implementation.

    Optional: if not provided, it is assumed there is no queue on the
    device. Do not call this function directly, call [`tty_chars_in_buffer()`](tty_ioctl.md#c.tty_chars_in_buffer "tty_chars_in_buffer").

`ioctl`
:   `int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, unsigned int cmd,
    unsigned long arg)`

    > This routine allows the **tty** driver to implement device-specific
    > ioctls. If the ioctl number passed in **cmd** is not recognized by the
    > driver, it should return `ENOIOCTLCMD`.
    >
    > Optional.

`compat_ioctl`
:   `long ()(struct tty_struct *tty, unsigned int cmd,
    unsigned long arg)`

    > Implement ioctl processing for 32 bit process on 64 bit system.
    >
    > Optional.

`set_termios`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty, const struct ktermios *old)`

    This routine allows the **tty** driver to be notified when device's
    termios settings have changed. New settings are in **tty->termios**.
    Previous settings are passed in the **old** argument.

    The API is defined such that the driver should return the actual modes
    selected. This means that the driver is responsible for modifying any
    bits in **tty->termios** it cannot fulfill to indicate the actual modes
    being used.

    Optional. Called under the **tty->termios_rwsem**. May sleep.

`throttle`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)`

    This routine notifies the **tty** driver that input buffers for the line
    discipline are close to full, and it should somehow signal that no more
    characters should be sent to the **tty**.

    Serialization including with **unthrottle()** is the job of the ldisc
    layer.

    Optional: Always invoke via [`tty_throttle_safe()`](tty_ioctl.md#c.tty_throttle_safe "tty_throttle_safe"). Called under the
    **tty->termios_rwsem**.

`unthrottle`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)`

    This routine notifies the **tty** driver that it should signal that
    characters can now be sent to the **tty** without fear of overrunning the
    input buffers of the line disciplines.

    Optional. Always invoke via [`tty_unthrottle()`](tty_ioctl.md#c.tty_unthrottle "tty_unthrottle"). Called under the
    **tty->termios_rwsem**.

`stop`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)`

    This routine notifies the **tty** driver that it should stop outputting
    characters to the tty device.

    Called with **tty->flow.lock** held. Serialized with **[`start()`](../../networking/ieee802154.md#c.start "start")** method.

    Optional. Always invoke via [`stop_tty()`](tty_struct.md#c.stop_tty "stop_tty").

`start`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)`

    This routine notifies the **tty** driver that it resumed sending
    characters to the **tty** device.

    Called with **tty->flow.lock** held. Serialized with [`stop()`](../../networking/ieee802154.md#c.stop "stop") method.

    Optional. Always invoke via [`start_tty()`](tty_struct.md#c.start_tty "start_tty").

`hangup`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)`

    This routine notifies the **tty** driver that it should hang up the **tty**
    device.

    Optional. Called with tty lock held.

`break_ctl`
:   `int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, int state)`

    This optional routine requests the **tty** driver to turn on or off BREAK
    status on the RS-232 port. If **state** is -1, then the BREAK status
    should be turned on; if **state** is 0, then BREAK should be turned off.

    If this routine is implemented, the high-level tty driver will handle
    the following ioctls: `TCSBRK`, `TCSBRKP`, `TIOCSBRK`, `TIOCCBRK`.

    If the driver sets `TTY_DRIVER_HARDWARE_BREAK` in tty_alloc_driver(),
    then the interface will also be called with actual times and the
    hardware is expected to do the delay work itself. 0 and -1 are still
    used for on/off.

    Optional: Required for `TCSBRK`/`BRKP`/etc. handling. May sleep.

`flush_buffer`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)`

    This routine discards device private output buffer. Invoked on close,
    hangup, to implement `TCOFLUSH` ioctl and similar.

    Optional: if not provided, it is assumed there is no queue on the
    device. Do not call this function directly, call
    [`tty_driver_flush_buffer()`](tty_ioctl.md#c.tty_driver_flush_buffer "tty_driver_flush_buffer").

`set_ldisc`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)`

    This routine allows the **tty** driver to be notified when the device's
    line discipline is being changed. At the point this is done the
    discipline is not yet usable.

    Optional. Called under the **tty->ldisc_sem** and **tty->termios_rwsem**.

`wait_until_sent`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty, int timeout)`

    This routine waits until the device has written out all of the
    characters in its transmitter FIFO. Or until **timeout** (in jiffies) is
    reached.

    Optional: If not provided, the device is assumed to have no FIFO.
    Usually correct to invoke via [`tty_wait_until_sent()`](tty_ioctl.md#c.tty_wait_until_sent "tty_wait_until_sent"). May sleep.

`send_xchar`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty, u8 ch)`

    This routine is used to send a high-priority XON/XOFF character (**ch**)
    to the **tty** device.

    Optional: If not provided, then the **write** method is called under
    the **tty->atomic_write_lock** to keep it serialized with the ldisc.

`tiocmget`
:   `int ()(struct tty_struct *tty)`

    This routine is used to obtain the modem status bits from the **tty**
    driver.

    Optional: If not provided, then `ENOTTY` is returned from the `TIOCMGET`
    ioctl. Do not call this function directly, call [`tty_tiocmget()`](tty_internals.md#c.tty_tiocmget "tty_tiocmget").

`tiocmset`
:   `int ()(struct tty_struct *tty,
    unsigned int set, unsigned int clear)`

    > This routine is used to set the modem status bits to the **tty** driver.
    > First, **clear** bits should be cleared, then **set** bits set.
    >
    > Optional: If not provided, then `ENOTTY` is returned from the `TIOCMSET`
    > ioctl. Do not call this function directly, call [`tty_tiocmset()`](tty_internals.md#c.tty_tiocmset "tty_tiocmset").

`resize`
:   `int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, struct winsize *ws)`

    Called when a termios request is issued which changes the requested
    terminal geometry to **ws**.

    Optional: the default action is to update the termios structure
    without error. This is usually the correct behaviour. Drivers should
    not force errors here if they are not resizable objects (e.g. a serial
    line). See [`tty_do_resize()`](tty_struct.md#c.tty_do_resize "tty_do_resize") if you need to wrap the standard method
    in your own logic -- the usual case.

`get_icount`
:   `int ()(struct tty_struct *tty,
    struct serial_icounter *icount)`

    > Called when the **tty** device receives a `TIOCGICOUNT` ioctl. Passed a
    > kernel structure **icount** to complete.
    >
    > Optional: called only if provided, otherwise `ENOTTY` will be returned.

`get_serial`
:   `int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, struct serial_struct *p)`

    Called when the **tty** device receives a `TIOCGSERIAL` ioctl. Passed a
    kernel structure **p** (`struct serial_struct`) to complete.

    Optional: called only if provided, otherwise `ENOTTY` will be returned.
    Do not call this function directly, call tty_tiocgserial().

`set_serial`
:   `int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, struct serial_struct *p)`

    Called when the **tty** device receives a `TIOCSSERIAL` ioctl. Passed a
    kernel structure **p** (`struct serial_struct`) to set the values from.

    Optional: called only if provided, otherwise `ENOTTY` will be returned.
    Do not call this function directly, call tty_tiocsserial().

`show_fdinfo`
:   `void ()(struct tty_struct *tty, struct seq_file *m)`

    Called when the **tty** device file descriptor receives a fdinfo request
    from VFS (to show in /proc/<pid>/fdinfo/). **m** should be filled with
    information.

    Optional: called only if provided, otherwise nothing is written to **m**.
    Do not call this function directly, call tty_show_fdinfo().

`poll_init`
:   `int ()(struct tty_driver *driver, int line, char *options)`

    kgdboc support ([Using kgdb, kdb and the kernel debugger internals](../../dev-tools/kgdb.md)). This routine is
    called to initialize the HW for later use by calling **poll_get_char** or
    **poll_put_char**.

    Optional: called only if provided, otherwise skipped as a non-polling
    driver.

`poll_get_char`
:   `int ()(struct tty_driver *driver, int line)`

    kgdboc support (see **poll_init**). **driver** should read a character from a
    tty identified by **line** and return it.

    Optional: called only if **poll_init** provided.

`poll_put_char`
:   `void ()(struct tty_driver *driver, int line, char ch)`

    kgdboc support (see **poll_init**). **driver** should write character **ch** to
    a tty identified by **line**.

    Optional: called only if **poll_init** provided.

`proc_show`
:   `int ()(struct seq_file *m, void *driver)`

    Driver **driver** (cast to [`struct tty_driver`](tty_driver.md#c.tty_driver "tty_driver")) can show additional info in
    /proc/tty/driver/<driver_name>. It is enough to fill in the information
    into **m**.

    Optional: called only if provided, otherwise no /proc entry created.

**Description**

This structure defines the interface between the low-level tty driver and
the tty routines. These routines can be defined. Unless noted otherwise,
they are optional, and can be filled in with a `NULL` pointer.
