# Linux kernel SLIMbus support

## Overview

### What is SLIMbus?

SLIMbus (Serial Low Power Interchip Media Bus) is a specification developed by
MIPI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface) alliance. The bus uses master/slave
configuration, and is a 2-wire multi-drop implementation (clock, and data).

Currently, SLIMbus is used to interface between application processors of SoCs
(System-on-Chip) and peripheral components (typically codec). SLIMbus uses
Time-Division-Multiplexing to accommodate multiple data channels, and
a control channel.

The control channel is used for various control functions such as bus
management, configuration and status updates. These messages can be unicast (e.g.
reading/writing device specific values), or multicast (e.g. data channel
reconfiguration sequence is a broadcast message announced to all devices)

A data channel is used for data-transfer between 2 SLIMbus devices. Data
channel uses dedicated ports on the device.

### Hardware description:

SLIMbus specification has different types of device classifications based on
their capabilities.
A manager device is responsible for enumeration, configuration, and dynamic
channel allocation. Every bus has 1 active manager.

A generic device is a device providing application functionality (e.g. codec).

Framer device is responsible for clocking the bus, and transmitting frame-sync
and framing information on the bus.

Each SLIMbus component has an interface device for monitoring physical layer.

Typically each SoC contains SLIMbus component having 1 manager, 1 framer device,
1 generic device (for data channel support), and 1 interface device.
External peripheral SLIMbus component usually has 1 generic device (for
functionality/data channel support), and an associated interface device.
The generic device's registers are mapped as 'value elements' so that they can
be written/read using SLIMbus control channel exchanging control/status type of
information.
In case there are multiple framer devices on the same bus, manager device is
responsible to select the active-framer for clocking the bus.

Per specification, SLIMbus uses "clock gears" to do power management based on
current frequency and bandwidth requirements. There are 10 clock gears and each
gear changes the SLIMbus frequency to be twice its previous gear.

Each device has a 6-byte enumeration-address and the manager assigns every
device with a 1-byte logical address after the devices report presence on the
bus.

### Software description:

There are 2 types of SLIMbus drivers:

slim_controller represents a 'controller' for SLIMbus. This driver should
implement duties needed by the SoC (manager device, associated
interface device for monitoring the layers and reporting errors, default
framer device).

slim_device represents the 'generic device/component' for SLIMbus, and a
slim_driver should implement driver for that slim_device.

### Device notifications to the driver:

Since SLIMbus devices have mechanisms for reporting their presence, the
framework allows drivers to bind when corresponding devices report their
presence on the bus.
However, it is possible that the driver needs to be probed
first so that it can enable corresponding SLIMbus device (e.g. power it up and/or
take it out of reset). To support that behavior, the framework allows drivers
to probe first as well (e.g. using standard DeviceTree compatibility field).
This creates the necessity for the driver to know when the device is functional
(i.e. reported present). device_up callback is used for that reason when the
device reports present and is assigned a logical address by the controller.

Similarly, SLIMbus devices 'report absent' when they go down. A 'device_down'
callback notifies the driver when the device reports absent and its logical
address assignment is invalidated by the controller.

Another notification "boot_device" is used to notify the slim_driver when
controller resets the bus. This notification allows the driver to take necessary
steps to boot the device so that it's functional after the bus has been reset.

:   Setup logical address at laddr for the slave with elemental
    address e_addr. Drivers implementing controller will be expected to
    send unicast message to this device with its logical address.

`get_laddr`
:   It is possible that controller needs to set fixed logical

    can do this assignment. Use case is when the master is on the remote
    processor side, who is resposible for allocating laddr.

`disable_stream`

    'Manager device' is responsible for device management, bandwidth
    allocation, channel setup, and port associations per channel.
    Device management means Logical address assignment/removal based on
    enumeration (report-present, report-absent) of a device.
    Bandwidth allocation is done dynamically by the manager based on active
    channels on the bus, message-bandwidth requests made by SLIMbus devices.
    Based on current bandwidth usage, manager chooses a frequency to run
    the bus at (in steps of 'clock-gear', 1 through 10, each clock gear
    representing twice the frequency than the previous gear).
    Manager is also responsible for entering (and exiting) low-power-mode
    (known as 'clock pause').
    Manager can do handover of framer if there are multiple framers on the
    bus and a certain usecase warrants using certain framer to avoid keeping
    previous framer being powered-on.

    Controller here performs duties of the manager device, and 'interface
    device'. Interface device is responsible for monitoring the bus and
    reporting information such as loss-of-synchronization, data
    slot-collision.

`wakeup`

    to wake it up from clock-pause. Framework will call this to bring

:   get/allocate logical address of a SLIMbus device.

**Parameters**

`struct slim_device *sbdev`
:   client handle requesting the address.

**Return**

zero if a logical address is valid or a new logical address
has been assigned. error code in case of error.

### Clock-pause:

SLIMbus mandates that a reconfiguration sequence (known as clock-pause) be
broadcast to all active devices on the bus before the bus can enter low-power
mode. Controller uses this sequence when it decides to enter low-power mode so
that corresponding clocks and/or power-rails can be turned off to save power.
Clock-pause is exited by waking up framer device (if controller driver initiates
exiting low power mode), or by toggling the data line (if a slave device wants
to initiate it).

#### Clock-pause APIs:

int slim_ctrl_clk_pause(struct [slim_controller](slimbus.md#c.slim_controller "slim_controller") \*ctrl, bool wakeup, u8 restart)
:   Called by slimbus controller to enter/exit 'clock pause'

**Parameters**

`struct slim_controller *ctrl`
:   controller requesting bus to be paused or woken up

`bool wakeup`
:   Wakeup this controller from clock pause.

`u8 restart`
:   Restart time value per spec used for clock pause. This value
    isn't used when controller is to be woken up.

**Description**

Slimbus specification needs this sequence to turn-off clocks for the bus.
The sequence involves sending 3 broadcast messages (reconfiguration
sequence) to inform all devices on the bus.
To exit clock-pause, controller typically wakes up active framer device.
This API executes clock pause reconfiguration sequence if wakeup is false.
If wakeup is true, controller's wakeup is called.
For entering clock-pause, -EBUSY is returned if a message txn in pending.

### Messaging:

The framework supports regmap and read/write apis to exchange control-information
with a SLIMbus device. APIs can be synchronous or asynchronous.
The header file <linux/slimbus.h> has more documentation about messaging APIs.

#### Messaging APIs:

void slim_msg_response(struct [slim_controller](slimbus.md#c.slim_controller "slim_controller") \*ctrl, u8 \*reply, u8 tid, u8 len)
:   Deliver Message response received from a device to the framework.

to manage 1 more table other than the one managed by framework mapping TID
with buffers

#### Streaming APIs:

struct [slim_stream_runtime](slimbus.md#c.slim_stream_runtime "slim_stream_runtime") \*slim_stream_allocate(struct [slim_device](slimbus.md#c.slim_device "slim_device") \*dev, const char \*name)
