# Introduction

The main purpose of the Industrial I/O subsystem (IIO) is to provide support
for devices that in some sense perform either
analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) or digital-to-analog conversion (DAC)
or both. The aim is to fill the gap between the somewhat similar hwmon and
[input](../input.md) subsystems. Hwmon is directed at low sample rate
sensors used to monitor and control the system itself, like fan speed control
or temperature measurement. [Input](../input.md) is, as its name suggests,
focused on human interaction input devices (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen).
In some cases there is considerable overlap between these and IIO.

Devices that fall into this category include:

- analog to digital converters (ADCs)
- accelerometers
- capacitance to digital converters (CDCs)
- digital to analog converters (DACs)
- gyroscopes
- inertial measurement units (IMUs)
- color and light sensors
- magnetometers
- pressure sensors
- proximity sensors
- temperature sensors

Usually these sensors are connected via [SPI](../spi.md) or
[I2C](../i2c.md). A common use case of the sensors devices is to have
combined functionality (e.g. light plus proximity sensor).
