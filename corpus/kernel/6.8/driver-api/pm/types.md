`prepare`
:   The principal role of this callback is to prevent new children of
    the device from being registered after it has returned (the driver's
    subsystem and generally the rest of the kernel is supposed to prevent
    new calls to the probe method from being made too once **prepare()** has
    succeeded). If **prepare()** detects a situation it cannot handle (e.g.
    registration of a child already in progress), it may return -EAGAIN, so
    that the PM core can execute it once again (e.g. after a new child has
    been registered) to recover from the race condition.
    This method is executed for all kinds of suspend transitions and is
    followed by one of the suspend callbacks: **suspend()**, **freeze()**, or
    **poweroff()**. If the transition is a suspend to memory or standby (that
    is, not related to hibernation), the return value of **prepare()** may be
    used to indicate to the PM core to leave the device in runtime suspend
    if applicable. Namely, if **prepare()** returns a positive number, the PM
    core will understand that as a declaration that the device appears to be
    runtime-suspended and it may be left in that state during the entire
    transition and during the subsequent resume if all of its descendants
    are left in runtime suspend too. If that happens, **complete()** will be
    executed directly after **prepare()** and it must ensure the proper
    functioning of the device after the system resume.
    The PM core executes subsystem-level **prepare()** for all devices before
    starting to invoke suspend callbacks for any of them, so generally
    devices may be assumed to be functional or to respond to runtime resume
    requests while **prepare()** is being executed. However, device drivers
    may NOT assume anything about the availability of user space at that
    time and it is NOT valid to request firmware from within **prepare()**
    (it's too late to do that). It also is NOT valid to allocate
    substantial amounts of memory from **prepare()** in the GFP_KERNEL mode.
    [To work around these limitations, drivers may register suspend and
    hibernation notifiers to be executed before the freezing of tasks.]

`complete`
:   Undo the changes made by **prepare()**. This method is executed for
    all kinds of resume transitions, following one of the resume callbacks:
    **resume()**, **thaw()**, **restore()**. Also called if the state transition
    fails before the driver's suspend callback: **suspend()**, **freeze()** or
    **poweroff()**, can be executed (e.g. if the suspend callback fails for one
    of the other devices that the PM core has unsuccessfully attempted to
    suspend earlier).
    The PM core executes subsystem-level **complete()** after it has executed
    the appropriate resume callbacks for all devices. If the corresponding
    **prepare()** at the beginning of the suspend transition returned a
    positive number and the device was left in runtime suspend (without
    executing any suspend and resume callbacks for it), **complete()** will be
    the only callback executed for the device during resume. In that case,
    **complete()** must be prepared to do whatever is necessary to ensure the
    proper functioning of the device after the system resume. To this end,
    **complete()** can check the power.direct_complete flag of the device to
    learn whether (unset) or not (set) the previous suspend and resume
    callbacks have been executed for it.

`suspend`
:   Executed before putting the system into a sleep state in which the
    contents of main memory are preserved. The exact action to perform
    depends on the device's subsystem (PM domain, device type, class or bus
    type), but generally the device must be quiescent after subsystem-level
    **suspend()** has returned, so that it doesn't do any I/O or DMA.
    Subsystem-level **suspend()** is executed for all devices after invoking
    subsystem-level **prepare()** for all of them.

`resume`
:   Executed after waking the system up from a sleep state in which the
    contents of main memory were preserved. The exact action to perform
    depends on the device's subsystem, but generally the driver is expected
    to start working again, responding to hardware events and software
    requests (the device itself may be left in a low-power state, waiting
    for a runtime resume to occur). The state of the device at the time its
    driver's **resume()** callback is run depends on the platform and subsystem
    the device belongs to. On most platforms, there are no restrictions on
    availability of resources like clocks during **resume()**.
    Subsystem-level **resume()** is executed for all devices after invoking
    subsystem-level **resume_noirq()** for all of them.

`freeze`
:   Hibernation-specific, executed before creating a hibernation image.
    Analogous to **suspend()**, but it should not enable the device to signal
    wakeup events or change its power state. The majority of subsystems
    (with the notable exception of the PCI bus type) expect the driver-level
    **freeze()** to save the device settings in memory to be used by **restore()**
    during the subsequent resume from hibernation.
    Subsystem-level **freeze()** is executed for all devices after invoking
    subsystem-level **prepare()** for all of them.

`thaw`
:   Hibernation-specific, executed after creating a hibernation image OR
    if the creation of an image has failed. Also executed after a failing
    attempt to restore the contents of main memory from such an image.
    Undo the changes made by the preceding **freeze()**, so the device can be
    operated in the same way as immediately before the call to **freeze()**.
    Subsystem-level **thaw()** is executed for all devices after invoking
    subsystem-level **thaw_noirq()** for all of them. It also may be executed
    directly after **freeze()** in case of a transition error.

`poweroff`
:   Hibernation-specific, executed after saving a hibernation image.
    Analogous to **suspend()**, but it need not save the device's settings in
    memory.
    Subsystem-level **poweroff()** is executed for all devices after invoking
    subsystem-level **prepare()** for all of them.

`restore`
:   Hibernation-specific, executed after restoring the contents of main
    memory from a hibernation image, analogous to **resume()**.

`suspend_late`
:   Continue operations started by **suspend()**. For a number of
    devices **suspend_late()** may point to the same callback routine as the
    runtime suspend callback.

`resume_early`
:   Prepare to execute **resume()**. For a number of devices
    **resume_early()** may point to the same callback routine as the runtime
    resume callback.

`freeze_late`
:   Continue operations started by **freeze()**. Analogous to
    **suspend_late()**, but it should not enable the device to signal wakeup
    events or change its power state.

`thaw_early`
:   Prepare to execute **thaw()**. Undo the changes made by the
    preceding **freeze_late()**.

`poweroff_late`
:   Continue operations started by **poweroff()**. Analogous to
    **suspend_late()**, but it need not save the device's settings in memory.

`restore_early`
:   Prepare to execute **restore()**, analogous to **resume_early()**.

`suspend_noirq`
:   Complete the actions started by **suspend()**. Carry out any
    additional operations required for suspending the device that might be
    racing with its driver's interrupt handler, which is guaranteed not to
    run while **suspend_noirq()** is being executed.
    It generally is expected that the device will be in a low-power state
    (appropriate for the target system sleep state) after subsystem-level
    **suspend_noirq()** has returned successfully. If the device can generate
    system wakeup signals and is enabled to wake up the system, it should be
    configured to do so at that time. However, depending on the platform
    and device's subsystem, **suspend()** or **suspend_late()** may be allowed to
    put the device into the low-power state and configure it to generate
    wakeup signals, in which case it generally is not necessary to define
    **suspend_noirq()**.

`resume_noirq`
:   Prepare for the execution of **resume()** by carrying out any
    operations required for resuming the device that might be racing with
    its driver's interrupt handler, which is guaranteed not to run while
    **resume_noirq()** is being executed.

`freeze_noirq`
:   Complete the actions started by **freeze()**. Carry out any
    additional operations required for freezing the device that might be
    racing with its driver's interrupt handler, which is guaranteed not to
    run while **freeze_noirq()** is being executed.
    The power state of the device should not be changed by either **freeze()**,
    or **freeze_late()**, or **freeze_noirq()** and it should not be configured to
    signal system wakeup by any of these callbacks.

`thaw_noirq`
:   Prepare for the execution of **thaw()** by carrying out any
    operations required for thawing the device that might be racing with its
    driver's interrupt handler, which is guaranteed not to run while
    **thaw_noirq()** is being executed.

`poweroff_noirq`
:   Complete the actions started by **poweroff()**. Analogous to
    **suspend_noirq()**, but it need not save the device's settings in memory.

`restore_noirq`
:   Prepare for the execution of **restore()** by carrying out any
    operations required for thawing the device that might be racing with its
    driver's interrupt handler, which is guaranteed not to run while
    **restore_noirq()** is being executed. Analogous to **resume_noirq()**.

`runtime_suspend`
:   Prepare the device for a condition in which it won't be
    able to communicate with the CPU(s) and RAM due to power management.
    This need not mean that the device should be put into a low-power state.
    For example, if the device is behind a link which is about to be turned
    off, the device may remain at full power. If the device does go to low
    power and is capable of generating runtime wakeup events, remote wakeup
    (i.e., a hardware mechanism allowing the device to request a change of
    its power state via an interrupt) should be enabled for it.

`runtime_resume`
:   Put the device into the fully active state in response to a
    wakeup event generated by hardware or at the request of software. If
    necessary, put the device into the full-power state and restore its
    registers, so that it is fully operational.

`runtime_idle`
:   Device appears to be inactive and it might be put into a
    low-power state if all of the necessary conditions are satisfied.
    Check these conditions, and return 0 if it's appropriate to let the PM
    core queue a suspend request for the device.

**Description**

Several device power state transitions are externally visible, affecting
the state of pending I/O queues and (for drivers that touch hardware)
interrupts, wakeups, DMA, and other hardware state. There may also be
internal transitions to various low-power modes which are transparent
to the rest of the driver stack (such as a driver that's ON gating off
clocks which are not in active use).

The externally visible transitions are handled with the help of callbacks
included in this structure in such a way that, typically, two levels of
callbacks are involved. First, the PM core executes callbacks provided by PM
domains, device types, classes and bus types. They are the subsystem-level
callbacks expected to execute callbacks provided by device drivers, although
they may choose not to do that. If the driver callbacks are executed, they
have to collaborate with the subsystem-level callbacks to achieve the goals
appropriate for the given system transition, given transition phase and the
subsystem the device belongs to.

All of the above callbacks, except for **complete()**, return error codes.
However, the error codes returned by **resume()**, **thaw()**, **restore()**,
**resume_noirq()**, **thaw_noirq()**, and **restore_noirq()**, do not cause the PM
core to abort the resume transition during which they are returned. The
error codes returned in those cases are only printed to the system logs for
debugging purposes. Still, it is recommended that drivers only return error
codes from their resume methods in case of an unrecoverable failure (i.e.
when the device being handled refuses to resume and becomes unusable) to
allow the PM core to be modified in the future, so that it can avoid
attempting to handle devices that failed to resume and their children.

It is allowed to unregister devices while the above callbacks are being
executed. However, a callback routine MUST NOT try to unregister the device
it was called for, although it may unregister children of that device (for
example, if it detects that a child was unplugged while the system was
asleep).

There also are callbacks related to runtime power management of devices.
Again, as a rule these callbacks are executed by the PM core for subsystems
(PM domains, device types, classes and bus types) and the subsystem-level
callbacks are expected to invoke the driver callbacks. Moreover, the exact
actions to be performed by a device driver's callbacks generally depend on
the platform and subsystem the device belongs to.

Refer to [Runtime Power Management Framework for I/O Devices](../../power/runtime_pm.md) for more information about the
role of the **runtime_suspend()**, **runtime_resume()** and **runtime_idle()**
callbacks in device runtime power management.

struct dev_pm_domain
:   power management domain representation.

**Definition**:

```
struct dev_pm_domain {
    struct dev_pm_ops       ops;
    int (*start)(struct device *dev);
    void (*detach)(struct device *dev, bool power_off);
    int (*activate)(struct device *dev);
    void (*sync)(struct device *dev);
    void (*dismiss)(struct device *dev);
    int (*set_performance_state)(struct device *dev, unsigned int state);
};
```

**Members**

`ops`
:   Power management operations associated with this domain.

`start`
:   Called when a user needs to start the device via the domain.

`detach`
:   Called when removing a device from the domain.

`activate`
:   Called before executing probe routines for bus types and drivers.

`sync`
:   Called after successful driver probe.

`dismiss`
:   Called after unsuccessful driver probe and after driver removal.

`set_performance_state`
:   Called to request a new performance state.

**Description**

Power domains provide callbacks that are executed during system suspend,
hibernation, system resume and during runtime PM transitions instead of
subsystem-level and driver-level callbacks.
