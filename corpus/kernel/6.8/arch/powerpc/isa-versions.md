# CPU to ISA Version Mapping

Mapping of some CPU versions to relevant ISA versions.

Note Power4 and Power4+ are not supported.

| CPU | Architecture version |
| --- | --- |
| Power10 | Power ISA v3.1 |
| Power9 | Power ISA v3.0B |
| Power8 | Power ISA v2.07 |
| e6500 | Power ISA v2.06 with some exceptions |
| e5500 | Power ISA v2.06 with some exceptions, no Altivec |
| Power7 | Power ISA v2.06 |
| Power6 | Power ISA v2.05 |
| PA6T | Power ISA v2.04 |
| Cell PPU | - Power ISA v2.02 with some minor exceptions - Plus Altivec/VMX ~= 2.03 |
| Power5++ | Power ISA v2.04 (no VMX) |
| Power5+ | Power ISA v2.03 |
| Power5 | - PowerPC User Instruction Set Architecture Book I v2.02 - PowerPC Virtual Environment Architecture Book II v2.02 - PowerPC Operating Environment Architecture Book III v2.02 |
| PPC970 | - PowerPC User Instruction Set Architecture Book I v2.01 - PowerPC Virtual Environment Architecture Book II v2.01 - PowerPC Operating Environment Architecture Book III v2.01 - Plus Altivec/VMX ~= 2.03 |
| Power4+ | - PowerPC User Instruction Set Architecture Book I v2.01 - PowerPC Virtual Environment Architecture Book II v2.01 - PowerPC Operating Environment Architecture Book III v2.01 |
| Power4 | - PowerPC User Instruction Set Architecture Book I v2.00 - PowerPC Virtual Environment Architecture Book II v2.00 - PowerPC Operating Environment Architecture Book III v2.00 |
