# Userland interfaces

The DRM core exports several interfaces to applications, generally
intended to be used through corresponding libdrm wrapper functions. In
addition, drivers export device-specific interfaces for use by userspace
drivers & device-aware applications through ioctls and sysfs files.

External interfaces include: memory mapping, context management, DMA
operations, AGP management, vblank control, fence management, memory
management, and output management.

Cover generic ioctls and sysfs layout here. We only need high-level
info, since man pages should cover the rest.

## libdrm Device Lookup

BEWARE THE DRAGONS! MIND THE TRAPDOORS!

In an attempt to warn anyone else who's trying to figure out what's going
on here, I'll try to summarize the story. First things first, let's clear up
the names, because the kernel internals, libdrm and the ioctls are all named
differently:

> - GET_UNIQUE ioctl, implemented by drm_getunique is wrapped up in libdrm
>   through the drmGetBusid function.
> - The libdrm drmSetBusid function is backed by the SET_UNIQUE ioctl. All
>   that code is nerved in the kernel with [`drm_invalid_op()`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_invalid_op "drm_invalid_op").
> - The internal set_busid kernel functions and driver callbacks are
>   exclusively use by the SET_VERSION ioctl, because only drm 1.0 (which is
>   nerved) allowed userspace to set the busid through the above ioctl.
> - Other ioctls and functions involved are named consistently.

For anyone wondering what's the difference between drm 1.1 and 1.4: Correctly
handling pci domains in the busid on ppc. Doing this correctly was only
implemented in libdrm in 2010, hence can't be nerved yet. No one knows what's
special with drm 1.2 and 1.3.

Now the actual horror story of how device lookup in drm works. At large,
there's 2 different ways, either by busid, or by device driver name.

Opening by busid is fairly simple:

1. First call SET_VERSION to make sure pci domains are handled properly. As a
   side-effect this fills out the unique name in the master structure.
2. Call GET_UNIQUE to read out the unique name from the master structure,
   which matches the busid thanks to step 1. If it doesn't, proceed to try
   the next device node.

Opening by name is slightly different:

1. Directly call VERSION to get the version and to match against the driver
   name returned by that ioctl. Note that SET_VERSION is not called, which
   means the unique name for the master node just opening is _not_ filled
   out. This despite that with current drm device nodes are always bound to
   one device, and can't be runtime assigned like with drm 1.0.
2. Match driver name. If it mismatches, proceed to the next device node.
3. Call GET_UNIQUE, and check whether the unique name has length zero (by
   checking that the first byte in the string is 0). If that's not the case
   libdrm skips and proceeds to the next device node. Probably this is just
   copypasta from drm 1.0 times where a set unique name meant that the driver
   was in use already, but that's just conjecture.

Long story short: To keep the open by name logic working, GET_UNIQUE must
_not_ return a unique string when SET_VERSION hasn't been called yet,
otherwise libdrm breaks. Even when that unique string can't ever change, and
is totally irrelevant for actually opening the device because runtime
assignable device instances were only support in drm 1.0, which is long dead.
But the libdrm code in drmOpenByName somehow survived, hence this can't be
broken.

## Primary Nodes, DRM Master and Authentication

[`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") is used to track groups of clients with open
primary device nodes. For every [`struct drm_file`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") which has had at
least once successfully became the device master (either through the
SET_MASTER IOCTL, or implicitly through opening the primary device node when
no one else is the current master that time) there exists one [`drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master").
This is noted in [`drm_file.is_master`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file"). All other clients have just a pointer
to the [`drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") they are associated with.

In addition only one [`drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") can be the current master for a [`drm_device`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device").
It can be switched through the DROP_MASTER and SET_MASTER IOCTL, or
implicitly through closing/opening the primary device node. See also
[`drm_is_current_master()`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_is_current_master "drm_is_current_master").

Clients can authenticate against the current master (if it matches their own)
using the GETMAGIC and AUTHMAGIC IOCTLs. Together with exchanging masters,
this allows controlled access to the device for an entire group of mutually
trusted clients.

bool drm_is_current_master(struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*fpriv)
:   checks whether **priv** is the current master

**Parameters**

`struct drm_file *fpriv`
:   DRM file private

**Description**

Checks whether **fpriv** is current master on its device. This decides whether a
client is allowed to run DRM_MASTER IOCTLs.

Most of the modern IOCTL which require DRM_MASTER are for kernel modesetting
- the current master is assumed to own the non-shareable display hardware.

struct [drm_master](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") \*drm_master_get(struct [drm_master](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") \*master)
:   reference a master pointer

**Parameters**

`struct drm_master *master`
:   [`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master")

**Description**

Increments the reference count of **master** and returns a pointer to **master**.

struct [drm_master](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") \*drm_file_get_master(struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*file_priv)
:   reference [`drm_file.master`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") of **file_priv**

**Parameters**

`struct drm_file *file_priv`
:   DRM file private

**Description**

Increments the reference count of **file_priv**'s [`drm_file.master`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") and returns
the [`drm_file.master`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file"). If **file_priv** has no [`drm_file.master`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file"), returns NULL.

Master pointers returned from this function should be unreferenced using
[`drm_master_put()`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master_put "drm_master_put").

void drm_master_put(struct [drm_master](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") \*\*master)
:   unreference and clear a master pointer

**Parameters**

`struct drm_master **master`
:   pointer to a pointer of [`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master")

**Description**

This decrements the [`drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") behind **master** and sets it to NULL.

struct drm_master
:   drm master structure

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_master {
    struct kref refcount;
    struct drm_device *dev;
    char *unique;

    struct idr lessee_idr;
};
```

**Members**

`refcount`
:   Refcount for this master object.

`dev`
:   Link back to the DRM device

`unique`
:   Unique identifier: e.g. busid. Protected by
    [`drm_device.master_mutex`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device").

`unique_len`
:   Length of unique field. Protected by
    [`drm_device.master_mutex`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device").

`lessor`
:   Lease grantor, only set if this [`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") represents a
    lessee holding a lease of objects from **lessor**. Full owners of the
    device have this set to NULL.

    The lessor does not change once it's set in drm_lease_create(), and
    each lessee holds a reference to its lessor that it releases upon
    being destroyed in drm_lease_destroy().

    See also the [section on display resource leasing](drm-uapi.md#drm-leasing).

`lessee_id`
:   ID for lessees. Owners (i.e. **lessor** is NULL) always have ID 0.
    Protected by [`drm_device.mode_config`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device")'s [`drm_mode_config.idr_mutex`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_mode_config "drm_mode_config").

`lessee_list`

    This list is empty if no leases have been granted, or if all lessees
    have been destroyed. Since lessors are referenced by all their

:   Objects leased to this drm_master. Protected by
    [`drm_device.mode_config`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device")'s [`drm_mode_config.idr_mutex`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_mode_config "drm_mode_config").

    Objects are leased all together in drm_lease_create(), and are
    removed all together when the lease is revoked.

`lessee_idr`

    Protected by [`drm_device.mode_config`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device")'s [`drm_mode_config.idr_mutex`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_mode_config "drm_mode_config").

**Description**

Note that master structures are only relevant for the legacy/primary device
nodes, hence there can only be one per device, not one per drm_minor.

## DRM Display Resource Leasing

DRM leases provide information about whether a DRM master may control a DRM
mode setting object. This enables the creation of multiple DRM masters that
manage subsets of display resources.

The original DRM master of a device 'owns' the available drm resources. It
may create additional DRM masters and 'lease' resources which it controls
to the new DRM master. This gives the new DRM master control over the
leased resources until the owner revokes the lease, or the new DRM master
is closed. Some helpful terminology:

- An 'owner' is a [`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") that is not leasing objects from
  another [`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master"), and hence 'owns' the objects. The owner can be
  identified as the [`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") for which [`drm_master.lessor`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") is NULL.
- A 'lessor' is a [`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") which is leasing objects to one or more
  other [`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master"). Currently, lessees are not allowed to
  create sub-leases, hence the lessor is the same as the owner.
- A 'lessee' is a [`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") which is leasing objects from some
  other [`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master"). Each lessee only leases resources from a single
  lessor recorded in [`drm_master.lessor`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master"), and holds the set of objects that
  it is leasing in [`drm_master.leases`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master").
- A 'lease' is a contract between the lessor and lessee that identifies
  which resources may be controlled by the lessee. All of the resources
  that are leased must be owned by or leased to the lessor, and lessors are
  not permitted to lease the same object to multiple lessees.

The set of objects any [`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") 'controls' is limited to the set
of objects it leases (for lessees) or all objects (for owners).

Objects not controlled by a [`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") cannot be modified through
the various state manipulating ioctls, and any state reported back to user
space will be edited to make them appear idle and/or unusable. For
instance, connectors always report 'disconnected', while encoders
report no possible crtcs or clones.

Since each lessee may lease objects from a single lessor, display resource
leases form a tree of [`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master"). As lessees are currently not
allowed to create sub-leases, the tree depth is limited to 1. All of
these get activated simultaneously when the top level device owner changes
through the SETMASTER or DROPMASTER IOCTL, so [`drm_device.master`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") points to
the owner at the top of the lease tree (i.e. the [`struct drm_master`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") for which
[`drm_master.lessor`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master") is NULL). The full list of lessees that are leasing
objects from the owner can be searched via the owner's
[`drm_master.lessee_idr`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_master "drm_master").

## Open-Source Userspace Requirements

The DRM subsystem has stricter requirements than most other kernel subsystems on
what the userspace side for new uAPI needs to look like. This section here
explains what exactly those requirements are, and why they exist.

The short summary is that any addition of DRM uAPI requires corresponding
open-sourced userspace patches, and those patches must be reviewed and ready for
merging into a suitable and canonical upstream project.

GFX devices (both display and render/GPU side) are really complex bits of
hardware, with userspace and kernel by necessity having to work together really
closely. The interfaces, for rendering and modesetting, must be extremely wide
and flexible, and therefore it is almost always impossible to precisely define
them for every possible corner case. This in turn makes it really practically
infeasible to differentiate between behaviour that's required by userspace, and
which must not be changed to avoid regressions, and behaviour which is only an
accidental artifact of the current implementation.

Without access to the full source code of all userspace users that means it
becomes impossible to change the implementation details, since userspace could
depend upon the accidental behaviour of the current implementation in minute
details. And debugging such regressions without access to source code is pretty
much impossible. As a consequence this means:

- The Linux kernel's "no regression" policy holds in practice only for
  open-source userspace of the DRM subsystem. DRM developers are perfectly fine
  if closed-source blob drivers in userspace use the same uAPI as the open
  drivers, but they must do so in the exact same way as the open drivers.
  Creative (ab)use of the interfaces will, and in the past routinely has, lead
  to breakage.
- Any new userspace interface must have an open-source implementation as
  demonstration vehicle.

The other reason for requiring open-source userspace is uAPI review. Since the
kernel and userspace parts of a GFX stack must work together so closely, code
review can only assess whether a new interface achieves its goals by looking at
both sides. Making sure that the interface indeed covers the use-case fully
leads to a few additional requirements:

- The open-source userspace must not be a toy/test application, but the real
  thing. Specifically it needs to handle all the usual error and corner cases.
  These are often the places where new uAPI falls apart and hence essential to
  assess the fitness of a proposed interface.
- The userspace side must be fully reviewed and tested to the standards of that
  userspace project. For e.g. mesa this means piglit testcases and review on the
  mailing list. This is again to ensure that the new interface actually gets the
  job done. The userspace-side reviewer should also provide an Acked-by on the
  kernel uAPI patch indicating that they believe the proposed uAPI is sound and
  sufficiently documented and validated for userspace's consumption.
- The userspace patches must be against the canonical upstream, not some vendor
  fork. This is to make sure that no one cheats on the review and testing
  requirements by doing a quick fork.
- The kernel patch can only be merged after all the above requirements are met,
  but it **must** be merged to either drm-next or drm-misc-next **before** the
  userspace patches land. uAPI always flows from the kernel, doing things the
  other way round risks divergence of the uAPI definitions and header files.

These are fairly steep requirements, but have grown out from years of shared
pain and experience with uAPI added hastily, and almost always regretted about
just as fast. GFX devices change really fast, requiring a paradigm shift and
entire new set of uAPI interfaces every few years at least. Together with the
Linux kernel's guarantee to keep existing userspace running for 10+ years this
is already rather painful for the DRM subsystem, with multiple different uAPIs
for the same thing co-existing. If we add a few more complete mistakes into the
mix every year it would be entirely unmanageable.

## Render nodes

DRM core provides multiple character-devices for user-space to use.
Depending on which device is opened, user-space can perform a different
set of operations (mainly ioctls). The primary node is always created
and called card<num>. Additionally, a currently unused control node,
called controlD<num> is also created. The primary node provides all
legacy operations and historically was the only interface used by
userspace. With KMS, the control node was introduced. However, the
planned KMS control interface has never been written and so the control
node stays unused to date.

With the increased use of offscreen renderers and GPGPU applications,
clients no longer require running compositors or graphics servers to
make use of a GPU. But the DRM API required unprivileged clients to
authenticate to a DRM-Master prior to getting GPU access. To avoid this
step and to grant clients GPU access without authenticating, render
nodes were introduced. Render nodes solely serve render clients, that
is, no modesetting or privileged ioctls can be issued on render nodes.
Only non-global rendering commands are allowed. If a driver supports
render nodes, it must advertise it via the DRIVER_RENDER DRM driver
capability. If not supported, the primary node must be used for render
clients together with the legacy drmAuth authentication procedure.

If a driver advertises render node support, DRM core will create a
separate render node called renderD<num>. There will be one render node
per device. No ioctls except PRIME-related ioctls will be allowed on
this node. Especially GEM_OPEN will be explicitly prohibited. For a
complete list of driver-independent ioctls that can be used on render
nodes, see the ioctls marked DRM_RENDER_ALLOW in drm_ioctl.c Render
nodes are designed to avoid the buffer-leaks, which occur if clients
guess the flink names or mmap offsets on the legacy interface.
Additionally to this basic interface, drivers must mark their
driver-dependent render-only ioctls as DRM_RENDER_ALLOW so render
clients can use them. Driver authors must be careful not to allow any
privileged ioctls on render nodes.

With render nodes, user-space can now control access to the render node
via basic file-system access-modes. A running graphics server which
authenticates clients on the privileged primary/legacy node is no longer
required. Instead, a client can open the render node and is immediately
granted GPU access. Communication between clients (or servers) is done
via PRIME. FLINK from render node to legacy node is not supported. New
clients must not use the insecure FLINK interface.

Besides dropping all modeset/global ioctls, render nodes also drop the
DRM-Master concept. There is no reason to associate render clients with
a DRM-Master as they are independent of any graphics server. Besides,
they must work without any running master, anyway. Drivers must be able
to run without a master object if they support render nodes. If, on the
other hand, a driver requires shared state between clients which is
visible to user-space and accessible beyond open-file boundaries, they
cannot support render nodes.

## Device Hot-Unplug

> **Note:**
>
> The following is the plan. Implementation is not there yet
> (2020 May).

Graphics devices (display and/or render) may be connected via USB (e.g.
display adapters or docking stations) or Thunderbolt (e.g. eGPU). An end
user is able to hot-unplug this kind of devices while they are being
used, and expects that the very least the machine does not crash. Any
damage from hot-unplugging a DRM device needs to be limited as much as
possible and userspace must be given the chance to handle it if it wants
to. Ideally, unplugging a DRM device still lets a desktop continue to
run, but that is going to need explicit support throughout the whole
graphics stack: from kernel and userspace drivers, through display
servers, via window system protocols, and in applications and libraries.

Other scenarios that should lead to the same are: unrecoverable GPU
crash, PCI device disappearing off the bus, or forced unbind of a driver
from the physical device.

In other words, from userspace perspective everything needs to keep on
working more or less, until userspace stops using the disappeared DRM
device and closes it completely. Userspace will learn of the device
disappearance from the device removed uevent, ioctls returning ENODEV
(or driver-specific ioctls returning driver-specific things), or open()
returning ENXIO.

Only after userspace has closed all relevant DRM device and dmabuf file
descriptors and removed all mmaps, the DRM driver can tear down its
instance for the device that no longer exists. If the same physical
device somehow comes back in the mean time, it shall be a new DRM
device.

Similar to PIDs, chardev minor numbers are not recycled immediately. A
new DRM device always picks the next free minor number compared to the
previous one allocated, and wraps around when minor numbers are
exhausted.

The goal raises at least the following requirements for the kernel and
drivers.

### Requirements for KMS UAPI

- KMS connectors must change their status to disconnected.
- Legacy modesets and pageflips, and atomic commits, both real and
  TEST_ONLY, and any other ioctls either fail with ENODEV or fake
  success.
- Pending non-blocking KMS operations deliver the DRM events userspace
  is expecting. This applies also to ioctls that faked success.
- open() on a device node whose underlying device has disappeared will
  fail with ENXIO.
- Attempting to create a DRM lease on a disappeared DRM device will
  fail with ENODEV. Existing DRM leases remain and work as listed
  above.

### Requirements for Render and Cross-Device UAPI

- All GPU jobs that can no longer run must have their fences
  force-signalled to avoid inflicting hangs on userspace.
  The associated error code is ENODEV.
- Some userspace APIs already define what should happen when the device
  disappears (OpenGL, GL ES: [GL_KHR_robustness](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/KHR/KHR_robustness.txt); [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/):
  VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST; etc.). DRM drivers are free to implement this
  behaviour the way they see best, e.g. returning failures in
  driver-specific ioctls and handling those in userspace drivers, or
  rely on uevents, and so on.
- dmabuf which point to memory that has disappeared will either fail to
  import with ENODEV or continue to be successfully imported if it would
  have succeeded before the disappearance. See also about memory maps
  below for already imported dmabufs.
- Attempting to import a dmabuf to a disappeared device will either fail
  with ENODEV or succeed if it would have succeeded without the
  disappearance.
- open() on a device node whose underlying device has disappeared will
  fail with ENXIO.

### Requirements for Memory Maps

Memory maps have further requirements that apply to both existing maps
and maps created after the device has disappeared. If the underlying
memory disappears, the map is created or modified such that reads and
writes will still complete successfully but the result is undefined.
This applies to both userspace mmap()'d memory and memory pointed to by
dmabuf which might be mapped to other devices (cross-device dmabuf
imports).

Raising SIGBUS is not an option, because userspace cannot realistically
handle it. Signal handlers are global, which makes them extremely
difficult to use correctly from libraries like those that Mesa produces.
Signal handlers are not composable, you can't have different handlers
for GPU1 and GPU2 from different vendors, and a third handler for
mmapped regular files. Threads cause additional pain with signal
handling as well.

## Device reset

The GPU stack is really complex and is prone to errors, from hardware bugs,
faulty applications and everything in between the many layers. Some errors
require resetting the device in order to make the device usable again. This
section describes the expectations for DRM and usermode drivers when a
device resets and how to propagate the reset status.

Device resets can not be disabled without tainting the kernel, which can lead to
hanging the entire kernel through shrinkers/mmu_notifiers. Userspace role in
device resets is to propagate the message to the application and apply any
special policy for blocking guilty applications, if any. Corollary is that
debugging a hung GPU context require hardware support to be able to preempt such
a GPU context while it's stopped.

### Kernel Mode Driver

The KMD is responsible for checking if the device needs a reset, and to perform
it as needed. Usually a hang is detected when a job gets stuck executing. KMD
should keep track of resets, because userspace can query any time about the
reset status for a specific context. This is needed to propagate to the rest of
the stack that a reset has happened. Currently, this is implemented by each
driver separately, with no common DRM interface. Ideally this should be properly
integrated at DRM scheduler to provide a common ground for all drivers. After a
reset, KMD should reject new command submissions for affected contexts.

### User Mode Driver

After command submission, UMD should check if the submission was accepted or
rejected. After a reset, KMD should reject submissions, and UMD can issue an
ioctl to the KMD to check the reset status, and this can be checked more often
if the UMD requires it. After detecting a reset, UMD will then proceed to report
it to the application using the appropriate API error code, as explained in the
section below about robustness.

### Robustness

The only way to try to keep a graphical API context working after a reset is if
it complies with the robustness aspects of the graphical API that it is using.

Graphical APIs provide ways to applications to deal with device resets. However,
there is no guarantee that the app will use such features correctly, and a
userspace that doesn't support robust interfaces (like a non-robust
OpenGL context or API without any robustness support like libva) leave the
robustness handling entirely to the userspace driver. There is no strong
community consensus on what the userspace driver should do in that case,
since all reasonable approaches have some clear downsides.

#### OpenGL

Apps using OpenGL should use the available robust interfaces, like the
extension `GL_ARB_robustness` (or `GL_EXT_robustness` for OpenGL ES). This
interface tells if a reset has happened, and if so, all the context state is
considered lost and the app proceeds by creating new ones. There's no consensus
on what to do to if robustness is not in use.

#### Vulkan

Apps using Vulkan should check for `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` for submissions.
This error code means, among other things, that a device reset has happened and
it needs to recreate the contexts to keep going.

### Reporting causes of resets

Apart from propagating the reset through the stack so apps can recover, it's
really useful for driver developers to learn more about what caused the reset in
the first place. DRM devices should make use of devcoredump to store relevant
information about the reset, so this information can be added to user bug
reports.

## IOCTL Support on Device Nodes

First things first, driver private IOCTLs should only be needed for drivers
supporting rendering. Kernel modesetting is all standardized, and extended
through properties. There are a few exceptions in some existing drivers,
which define IOCTL for use by the display DRM master, but they all predate
properties.

Now if you do have a render driver you always have to support it through
driver private properties. There's a few steps needed to wire all the things
up.

First you need to define the structure for your IOCTL in your driver private
UAPI header in `include/uapi/drm/my_driver_drm.h`:

```
struct my_driver_operation {
        u32 some_thing;
        u32 another_thing;
};
```

Please make sure that you follow all the best practices from
`Documentation/process/botching-up-ioctls.rst`. Note that [`drm_ioctl()`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_ioctl "drm_ioctl")
automatically zero-extends structures, hence make sure you can add more stuff
at the end, i.e. don't put a variable sized array there.

Then you need to define your IOCTL number, using one of DRM_IO(), DRM_IOR(),
DRM_IOW() or DRM_IOWR(). It must start with the DRM_IOCTL_ prefix:

```
##define DRM_IOCTL_MY_DRIVER_OPERATION  *         DRM_IOW(DRM_COMMAND_BASE, struct my_driver_operation)
```

DRM driver private IOCTL must be in the range from DRM_COMMAND_BASE to
DRM_COMMAND_END. Finally you need an array of [`struct drm_ioctl_desc`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_ioctl_desc "drm_ioctl_desc") to wire
up the handlers and set the access rights:

```
static const struct drm_ioctl_desc my_driver_ioctls[] = {
    DRM_IOCTL_DEF_DRV(MY_DRIVER_OPERATION, my_driver_operation,
            DRM_AUTH|DRM_RENDER_ALLOW),
};
```

And then assign this to the [`drm_driver.ioctls`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") field in your driver
structure.

See the separate chapter on [file operations](drm-internals.md#drm-driver-fops) for how
the driver-specific IOCTLs are wired up.

### Recommended IOCTL Return Values

In theory a driver's IOCTL callback is only allowed to return very few error
codes. In practice it's good to abuse a few more. This section documents common
practice within the DRM subsystem:

ENOENT:
:   Strictly this should only be used when a file doesn't exist e.g. when
    calling the open() syscall. We reuse that to signal any kind of object
    lookup failure, e.g. for unknown GEM buffer object handles, unknown KMS
    object handles and similar cases.

ENOSPC:
:   Some drivers use this to differentiate "out of kernel memory" from "out
    of VRAM". Sometimes also applies to other limited gpu resources used for
    rendering (e.g. when you have a special limited compression buffer).
    Sometimes resource allocation/reservation issues in command submission
    IOCTLs are also signalled through EDEADLK.

    Simply running out of kernel/system memory is signalled through ENOMEM.

EPERM/EACCES:
:   Returned for an operation that is valid, but needs more privileges.
    E.g. root-only or much more common, DRM master-only operations return
    this when called by unpriviledged clients. There's no clear
    difference between EACCES and EPERM.

ENODEV:
:   The device is not present anymore or is not yet fully initialized.

EOPNOTSUPP:
:   Feature (like PRIME, modesetting, GEM) is not supported by the driver.

ENXIO:
:   Remote failure, either a hardware transaction (like i2c), but also used
    when the exporting driver of a shared dma-buf or fence doesn't support a
    feature needed.

EINTR:
:   DRM drivers assume that userspace restarts all IOCTLs. Any DRM IOCTL can
    return EINTR and in such a case should be restarted with the IOCTL
    parameters left unchanged.

EIO:
:   The GPU died and couldn't be resurrected through a reset. Modesetting
    hardware failures are signalled through the "link status" connector
    property.

EINVAL:
:   Catch-all for anything that is an invalid argument combination which
    cannot work.

IOCTL also use other error codes like ETIME, EFAULT, EBUSY, ENOTTY but their
usage is in line with the common meanings. The above list tries to just document
DRM specific patterns. Note that ENOTTY has the slightly unintuitive meaning of
"this IOCTL does not exist", and is used exactly as such in DRM.

drm_ioctl_t
:   **Typedef**: DRM ioctl function type.

**Syntax**

> `typedef int drm_ioctl_t (struct drm_device *dev, void *data, struct drm_file *file_priv)`

**Parameters**

`struct drm_device *dev`
:   DRM device inode

`void *data`
:   private pointer of the ioctl call

`struct drm_file *file_priv`
:   DRM file this ioctl was made on

**Description**

This is the DRM ioctl typedef. Note that [`drm_ioctl()`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_ioctl "drm_ioctl") has alrady copied **data**
into kernel-space, and will also copy it back, depending upon the read/write
settings in the ioctl command code.

drm_ioctl_compat_t
:   **Typedef**: compatibility DRM ioctl function type.

**Syntax**

> `typedef int drm_ioctl_compat_t (struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)`

**Parameters**

`struct file *filp`
:   file pointer

`unsigned int cmd`
:   ioctl command code

`unsigned long arg`
:   DRM file this ioctl was made on

**Description**

Just a typedef to make declaring an array of compatibility handlers easier.
New drivers shouldn't screw up the structure layout for their ioctl
structures and hence never need this.

enum drm_ioctl_flags
:   DRM ioctl flags

**Constants**

`DRM_AUTH`
:   This is for ioctl which are used for rendering, and require that the
    file descriptor is either for a render node, or if it's a
    legacy/primary node, then it must be authenticated.

`DRM_MASTER`
:   This must be set for any ioctl which can change the modeset or
    display state. Userspace must call the ioctl through a primary node,
    while it is the active master.

    Note that read-only modeset ioctl can also be called by
    unauthenticated clients, or when a master is not the currently active
    one.

`DRM_ROOT_ONLY`
:   Anything that could potentially wreak a master file descriptor needs
    to have this flag set. Current that's only for the SETMASTER and
    DROPMASTER ioctl, which e.g. logind can call to force a non-behaving
    master (display compositor) into compliance.

    This is equivalent to callers with the SYSADMIN capability.

`DRM_RENDER_ALLOW`
:   This is used for all ioctl needed for rendering only, for drivers
    which support render nodes. This should be all new render drivers,
    and hence it should be always set for any ioctl with DRM_AUTH set.
    Note though that read-only query ioctl might have this set, but have
    not set DRM_AUTH because they do not require authentication.

**Description**

Various flags that can be set in [`drm_ioctl_desc.flags`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_ioctl_desc "drm_ioctl_desc") to control how
userspace can use a given ioctl.

struct drm_ioctl_desc
:   DRM driver ioctl entry

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_ioctl_desc {
    unsigned int cmd;
    enum drm_ioctl_flags flags;
    drm_ioctl_t *func;
    const char *name;
};
```

**Members**

`cmd`
:   ioctl command number, without flags

`flags`
:   a bitmask of [`enum drm_ioctl_flags`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_ioctl_flags "drm_ioctl_flags")

`func`
:   handler for this ioctl

`name`
:   user-readable name for debug output

**Description**

For convenience it's easier to create these using the [`DRM_IOCTL_DEF_DRV()`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_IOCTL_DEF_DRV "DRM_IOCTL_DEF_DRV")
macro.

DRM_IOCTL_DEF_DRV

`DRM_IOCTL_DEF_DRV (ioctl, _func, _flags)`

> helper macro to fill out a [`struct drm_ioctl_desc`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_ioctl_desc "drm_ioctl_desc")

**Parameters**

`ioctl`
:   ioctl command suffix

`_func`
:   handler for the ioctl

`_flags`
:   a bitmask of [`enum drm_ioctl_flags`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_ioctl_flags "drm_ioctl_flags")

**Description**

Small helper macro to create a [`struct drm_ioctl_desc`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_ioctl_desc "drm_ioctl_desc") entry. The ioctl
command number is constructed by prepending `DRM_IOCTL\_` and passing that
to DRM_IOCTL_NR().

int drm_noop(struct [drm_device](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") \*dev, void \*data, struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*file_priv)
:   DRM no-op ioctl implementation

**Parameters**

`struct drm_device *dev`
:   DRM device for the ioctl

`void *data`
:   data pointer for the ioctl

`struct drm_file *file_priv`
:   DRM file for the ioctl call

**Description**

This no-op implementation for drm ioctls is useful for deprecated
functionality where we can't return a failure code because existing userspace
checks the result of the ioctl, but doesn't care about the action.

Always returns successfully with 0.

int drm_invalid_op(struct [drm_device](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") \*dev, void \*data, struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*file_priv)
:   DRM invalid ioctl implementation

**Parameters**

`struct drm_device *dev`
:   DRM device for the ioctl

`void *data`
:   data pointer for the ioctl

`struct drm_file *file_priv`
:   DRM file for the ioctl call

**Description**

This no-op implementation for drm ioctls is useful for deprecated
functionality where we really don't want to allow userspace to call the ioctl
any more. This is the case for old ums interfaces for drivers that
transitioned to kms gradually and so kept the old legacy tables around. This
only applies to radeon and i915 kms drivers, other drivers shouldn't need to
use this function.

Always fails with a return value of -EINVAL.

long drm_ioctl(struct file \*filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)
:   ioctl callback implementation for DRM drivers

**Parameters**

`struct file *filp`
:   file this ioctl is called on

`unsigned int cmd`
:   ioctl cmd number

`unsigned long arg`
:   user argument

**Description**

Looks up the ioctl function in the DRM core and the driver dispatch table,
stored in [`drm_driver.ioctls`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver"). It checks for necessary permission by calling
drm_ioctl_permit(), and dispatches to the respective function.

**Return**

Zero on success, negative error code on failure.

bool drm_ioctl_flags(unsigned int nr, unsigned int \*flags)
:   Check for core ioctl and return ioctl permission flags

**Parameters**

`unsigned int nr`
:   ioctl number

`unsigned int *flags`
:   where to return the ioctl permission flags

**Description**

This ioctl is only used by the vmwgfx driver to augment the access checks
done by the drm core and insofar a pretty decent layering violation. This
shouldn't be used by any drivers.

**Return**

True if the **nr** corresponds to a DRM core ioctl number, false otherwise.

long drm_compat_ioctl(struct file \*filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)
:   32bit IOCTL compatibility handler for DRM drivers

**Parameters**

`struct file *filp`
:   file this ioctl is called on

`unsigned int cmd`
:   ioctl cmd number

`unsigned long arg`
:   user argument

**Description**

Compatibility handler for 32 bit userspace running on 64 kernels. All actual
IOCTL handling is forwarded to [`drm_ioctl()`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_ioctl "drm_ioctl"), while marshalling structures as
appropriate. Note that this only handles DRM core IOCTLs, if the driver has
botched IOCTL itself, it must handle those by wrapping this function.

**Return**

Zero on success, negative error code on failure.

## Testing and validation

### Testing Requirements for userspace API

New cross-driver userspace interface extensions, like new IOCTL, new KMS
properties, new files in sysfs or anything else that constitutes an API change
should have driver-agnostic testcases in IGT for that feature, if such a test
can be reasonably made using IGT for the target hardware.

### Validating changes with IGT

There's a collection of tests that aims to cover the whole functionality of
DRM drivers and that can be used to check that changes to DRM drivers or the
core don't regress existing functionality. This test suite is called IGT and
its code and instructions to build and run can be found in
<https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/igt-gpu-tools/>.

### Using VKMS to test DRM API

VKMS is a software-only model of a KMS driver that is useful for testing
and for running compositors. VKMS aims to enable a virtual display without
the need for a hardware display capability. These characteristics made VKMS
a perfect tool for validating the DRM core behavior and also support the
compositor developer. VKMS makes it possible to test DRM functions in a
virtual machine without display, simplifying the validation of some of the
core changes.

To Validate changes in DRM API with VKMS, start setting the kernel: make
sure to enable VKMS module; compile the kernel with the VKMS enabled and
install it in the target machine. VKMS can be run in a Virtual Machine
(QEMU, virtme or similar). It's recommended the use of KVM with the minimum
of 1GB of RAM and four cores.

It's possible to run the IGT-tests in a VM in two ways:

> 1. Use IGT inside a VM
> 2. Use IGT from the host machine and write the results in a shared directory.

Following is an example of using a VM with a shared directory with
the host machine to run igt-tests. This example uses virtme:

```
$ virtme-run --rwdir /path/for/shared_dir --kdir=path/for/kernel/directory --mods=auto
```

Run the igt-tests in the guest machine. This example runs the 'kms_flip'
tests:

```
$ /path/for/igt-gpu-tools/scripts/run-tests.sh -p -s -t "kms_flip.*" -v
```

In this example, instead of building the igt_runner, Piglit is used
(-p option). It creates an HTML summary of the test results and saves
them in the folder "igt-gpu-tools/results". It executes only the igt-tests
matching the -t option.

### Display CRC Support

DRM device drivers can provide to userspace CRC information of each frame as
it reached a given hardware component (a CRC sampling "source").

Userspace can control generation of CRCs in a given CRTC by writing to the
file dri/0/crtc-N/crc/control in debugfs, with N being the [index of
the CRTC](drm-uapi.md#crtc-index). Accepted values are source names (which are
driver-specific) and the "auto" keyword, which will let the driver select a
default source of frame CRCs for this CRTC.

Once frame CRC generation is enabled, userspace can capture them by reading
the dri/0/crtc-N/crc/data file. Each line in that file contains the frame
number in the first field and then a number of unsigned integer fields
containing the CRC data. Fields are separated by a single space and the number
of CRC fields is source-specific.

Note that though in some cases the CRC is computed in a specified way and on
the frame contents as supplied by userspace (eDP 1.3), in general the CRC
computation is performed in an unspecified way and on frame contents that have
been already processed in also an unspecified way and thus userspace cannot
rely on being able to generate matching CRC values for the frame contents that
it submits. In this general case, the maximum userspace can do is to compare
the reported CRCs of frames that should have the same contents.

On the driver side the implementation effort is minimal, drivers only need to
implement [`drm_crtc_funcs.set_crc_source`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_crtc_funcs "drm_crtc_funcs") and [`drm_crtc_funcs.verify_crc_source`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_crtc_funcs "drm_crtc_funcs").
The debugfs files are automatically set up if those vfuncs are set. CRC samples
need to be captured in the driver by calling [`drm_crtc_add_crc_entry()`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_crtc_add_crc_entry "drm_crtc_add_crc_entry").
Depending on the driver and HW requirements, [`drm_crtc_funcs.set_crc_source`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_crtc_funcs "drm_crtc_funcs")
may result in a commit (even a full modeset).

CRC results must be reliable across non-full-modeset atomic commits, so if a
commit via DRM_IOCTL_MODE_ATOMIC would disable or otherwise interfere with
CRC generation, then the driver must mark that commit as a full modeset
([`drm_atomic_crtc_needs_modeset()`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_atomic_crtc_needs_modeset "drm_atomic_crtc_needs_modeset") should return true). As a result, to ensure
consistent results, generic userspace must re-setup CRC generation after a
legacy SETCRTC or an atomic commit with DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_ALLOW_MODESET.

int drm_crtc_add_crc_entry(struct [drm_crtc](drm-kms.md#c.drm_crtc "drm_crtc") \*crtc, bool has_frame, uint32_t frame, uint32_t \*crcs)
:   Add entry with CRC information for a frame

**Parameters**

`struct drm_crtc *crtc`
:   CRTC to which the frame belongs

`bool has_frame`
:   whether this entry has a frame number to go with

`uint32_t frame`
:   number of the frame these CRCs are about

`uint32_t *crcs`
:   array of CRC values, with length matching #drm_crtc_crc.values_cnt

**Description**

For each frame, the driver polls the source of CRCs for new data and calls
this function to add them to the buffer from where userspace reads.

FIXME:

No it doesn't make a hole lot of sense that we duplicate debugfs entries for
both the render and the primary nodes, but that's how this has organically
grown. It should probably be fixed, with a compatibility link, if needed.

struct drm_debugfs_info
:   debugfs info list entry

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_debugfs_info {
    const char *name;

[`struct drm_debugfs_info`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_debugfs_info "drm_debugfs_info") in the DRM device debugfs file list.

## Sysfs Support

DRM provides very little additional support to drivers for sysfs
interactions, beyond just all the standard stuff. Drivers who want to expose
additional sysfs properties and property groups can attach them at either
[`drm_device.dev`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") or [`drm_connector.kdev`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_connector "drm_connector").

Registration is automatically handled when calling [`drm_dev_register()`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_dev_register "drm_dev_register"), or
[`drm_connector_register()`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_connector_register "drm_connector_register") in case of hot-plugged connectors. Unregistration is
also automatically handled by [`drm_dev_unregister()`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_dev_unregister "drm_dev_unregister") and
[`drm_connector_unregister()`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_connector_unregister "drm_connector_unregister").

void drm_sysfs_hotplug_event(struct [drm_device](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") \*dev)
:   generate a DRM uevent

**Parameters**

`struct drm_device *dev`
:   DRM device

**Description**

Send a uevent for the DRM device specified by **dev**. Currently we only
set HOTPLUG=1 in the uevent environment, but this could be expanded to
deal with other types of events.

Any new uapi should be using the drm_sysfs_connector_status_event()
for uevents on connector status change.

void drm_sysfs_connector_hotplug_event(struct [drm_connector](drm-kms.md#c.drm_connector "drm_connector") \*connector)
:   generate a DRM uevent for any connector change

**Parameters**

`struct drm_connector *connector`
:   connector which has changed

**Description**

Send a uevent for the DRM connector specified by **connector**. This will send
a uevent with the properties HOTPLUG=1 and CONNECTOR.

void drm_sysfs_connector_property_event(struct [drm_connector](drm-kms.md#c.drm_connector "drm_connector") \*connector, struct [drm_property](drm-kms.md#c.drm_property "drm_property") \*property)
:   generate a DRM uevent for connector property change

**Parameters**

`struct drm_connector *connector`
:   connector on which property changed

`struct drm_property *property`
:   connector property which has changed.

**Description**

Send a uevent for the specified DRM connector and property. Currently we
set HOTPLUG=1 and connector id along with the attached property id
related to the change.

int drm_class_device_register(struct [device](../driver-api/infrastructure.md#c.device "device") \*dev)
:   register new device with the DRM sysfs class

**Parameters**

`struct device *dev`
:   device to register

**Description**

Registers a new [`struct device`](../driver-api/infrastructure.md#c.device "device") within the DRM sysfs class. Essentially only
used by ttm to have a place for its global settings. Drivers should never use
this.

void drm_class_device_unregister(struct [device](../driver-api/infrastructure.md#c.device "device") \*dev)
:   unregister device with the DRM sysfs class

**Parameters**

`struct device *dev`
:   device to unregister

**Description**

Unregisters a [`struct device`](../driver-api/infrastructure.md#c.device "device") from the DRM sysfs class. Essentially only used
by ttm to have a place for its global settings. Drivers should never use
this.

## VBlank event handling

The DRM core exposes two vertical blank related ioctls:

`DRM_IOCTL_WAIT_VBLANK`
:   This takes a struct drm_wait_vblank structure as its argument, and
    it is used to block or request a signal when a specified vblank
    event occurs.

`DRM_IOCTL_MODESET_CTL`
:   This was only used for user-mode-settind drivers around modesetting
    changes to allow the kernel to update the vblank interrupt after
    mode setting, since on many devices the vertical blank counter is
    reset to 0 at some point during modeset. Modern drivers should not
    call this any more since with kernel mode setting it is a no-op.

## Userspace API Structures

DRM exposes many UAPI and structure definitions to have a consistent
and standardized interface with users.
Userspace can refer to these structure definitions and UAPI formats
to communicate to drivers.

### CRTC index

CRTC's have both an object ID and an index, and they are not the same thing.
The index is used in cases where a densely packed identifier for a CRTC is
needed, for instance a bitmask of CRTC's. The member possible_crtcs of [`struct
drm_mode_get_plane`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_mode_get_plane "drm_mode_get_plane") is an example.

`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_GETRESOURCES` populates a structure with an array of
CRTC ID's, and the CRTC index is its position in this array.

DRM_CAP_DUMB_BUFFER

`DRM_CAP_DUMB_BUFFER ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the driver supports creating dumb buffers via the
[`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB "DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB") ioctl.

DRM_CAP_VBLANK_HIGH_CRTC

`DRM_CAP_VBLANK_HIGH_CRTC ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the kernel supports specifying a [CRTC index](drm-uapi.md#crtc-index)
in the high bits of `drm_wait_vblank_request.type`.

Starting kernel version 2.6.39, this capability is always set to 1.

DRM_CAP_DUMB_PREFERRED_DEPTH

`DRM_CAP_DUMB_PREFERRED_DEPTH ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

The preferred bit depth for dumb buffers.

The bit depth is the number of bits used to indicate the color of a single
pixel excluding any padding. This is different from the number of bits per
pixel. For instance, XRGB8888 has a bit depth of 24 but has 32 bits per
pixel.

Note that this preference only applies to dumb buffers, it's irrelevant for
other types of buffers.

DRM_CAP_DUMB_PREFER_SHADOW

`DRM_CAP_DUMB_PREFER_SHADOW ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the driver prefers userspace to render to a shadow buffer
instead of directly rendering to a dumb buffer. For best speed, userspace
should do streaming ordered memory copies into the dumb buffer and never
read from it.

Note that this preference only applies to dumb buffers, it's irrelevant for
other types of buffers.

DRM_CAP_PRIME

`DRM_CAP_PRIME ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

Bitfield of supported PRIME sharing capabilities. See [`DRM_PRIME_CAP_IMPORT`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_PRIME_CAP_IMPORT "DRM_PRIME_CAP_IMPORT")
and [`DRM_PRIME_CAP_EXPORT`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_PRIME_CAP_EXPORT "DRM_PRIME_CAP_EXPORT").

Starting from kernel version 6.6, both [`DRM_PRIME_CAP_IMPORT`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_PRIME_CAP_IMPORT "DRM_PRIME_CAP_IMPORT") and
[`DRM_PRIME_CAP_EXPORT`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_PRIME_CAP_EXPORT "DRM_PRIME_CAP_EXPORT") are always advertised.

PRIME buffers are exposed as dma-buf file descriptors.
See [PRIME Buffer Sharing](drm-mm.md#prime-buffer-sharing).

DRM_PRIME_CAP_IMPORT

`DRM_PRIME_CAP_IMPORT ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If this bit is set in [`DRM_CAP_PRIME`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_CAP_PRIME "DRM_CAP_PRIME"), the driver supports importing PRIME
buffers via the [`DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_FD_TO_HANDLE`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_FD_TO_HANDLE "DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_FD_TO_HANDLE") ioctl.

Starting from kernel version 6.6, this bit is always set in [`DRM_CAP_PRIME`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_CAP_PRIME "DRM_CAP_PRIME").

DRM_PRIME_CAP_EXPORT

`DRM_PRIME_CAP_EXPORT ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If this bit is set in [`DRM_CAP_PRIME`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_CAP_PRIME "DRM_CAP_PRIME"), the driver supports exporting PRIME
buffers via the [`DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_HANDLE_TO_FD`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_HANDLE_TO_FD "DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_HANDLE_TO_FD") ioctl.

Starting from kernel version 6.6, this bit is always set in [`DRM_CAP_PRIME`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_CAP_PRIME "DRM_CAP_PRIME").

DRM_CAP_TIMESTAMP_MONOTONIC

`DRM_CAP_TIMESTAMP_MONOTONIC ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 0, the kernel will report timestamps with `CLOCK_REALTIME` in
struct drm_event_vblank. If set to 1, the kernel will report timestamps with
`CLOCK_MONOTONIC`. See `clock_gettime(2)` for the definition of these
clocks.

Starting from kernel version 2.6.39, the default value for this capability
is 1. Starting kernel version 4.15, this capability is always set to 1.

DRM_CAP_ASYNC_PAGE_FLIP

`DRM_CAP_ASYNC_PAGE_FLIP ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the driver supports [`DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_ASYNC`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_ASYNC "DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_ASYNC") for legacy
page-flips.

DRM_CAP_CURSOR_WIDTH

`DRM_CAP_CURSOR_WIDTH ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

The `CURSOR_WIDTH` and `CURSOR_HEIGHT` capabilities return a valid
width x height combination for the hardware cursor. The intention is that a
hardware agnostic userspace can query a cursor plane size to use.

Note that the cross-driver contract is to merely return a valid size;
drivers are free to attach another meaning on top, eg. i915 returns the
maximum plane size.

DRM_CAP_CURSOR_HEIGHT

`DRM_CAP_CURSOR_HEIGHT ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

See [`DRM_CAP_CURSOR_WIDTH`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_CAP_CURSOR_WIDTH "DRM_CAP_CURSOR_WIDTH").

DRM_CAP_ADDFB2_MODIFIERS

`DRM_CAP_ADDFB2_MODIFIERS ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the driver supports supplying modifiers in the
`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_ADDFB2` ioctl.

DRM_CAP_PAGE_FLIP_TARGET

`DRM_CAP_PAGE_FLIP_TARGET ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the driver supports the `DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_TARGET_ABSOLUTE` and
`DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_TARGET_RELATIVE` flags in
`drm_mode_crtc_page_flip_target.flags` for the `DRM_IOCTL_MODE_PAGE_FLIP`
ioctl.

DRM_CAP_CRTC_IN_VBLANK_EVENT

`DRM_CAP_CRTC_IN_VBLANK_EVENT ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the kernel supports reporting the CRTC ID in
`drm_event_vblank.crtc_id` for the [`DRM_EVENT_VBLANK`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_EVENT_VBLANK "DRM_EVENT_VBLANK") and
[`DRM_EVENT_FLIP_COMPLETE`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_EVENT_FLIP_COMPLETE "DRM_EVENT_FLIP_COMPLETE") events.

Starting kernel version 4.12, this capability is always set to 1.

DRM_CAP_SYNCOBJ

`DRM_CAP_SYNCOBJ ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the driver supports sync objects. See [DRM Sync Objects](drm-mm.md#drm-sync-objects).

DRM_CAP_SYNCOBJ_TIMELINE

`DRM_CAP_SYNCOBJ_TIMELINE ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the driver supports timeline operations on sync objects. See
[DRM Sync Objects](drm-mm.md#drm-sync-objects).

DRM_CAP_ATOMIC_ASYNC_PAGE_FLIP

`DRM_CAP_ATOMIC_ASYNC_PAGE_FLIP ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the driver supports [`DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_ASYNC`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_ASYNC "DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_ASYNC") for atomic
commits.

DRM_CLIENT_CAP_STEREO_3D

`DRM_CLIENT_CAP_STEREO_3D ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the DRM core will expose the stereo 3D capabilities of the
monitor by advertising the supported 3D layouts in the flags of [`struct
drm_mode_modeinfo`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_mode_modeinfo "drm_mode_modeinfo"). See `DRM_MODE_FLAG_3D_*`.

This capability is always supported for all drivers starting from kernel
version 3.13.

DRM_CLIENT_CAP_UNIVERSAL_PLANES

`DRM_CLIENT_CAP_UNIVERSAL_PLANES ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the DRM core will expose all planes (overlay, primary, and
cursor) to userspace.

This capability has been introduced in kernel version 3.15. Starting from
kernel version 3.17, this capability is always supported for all drivers.

DRM_CLIENT_CAP_ATOMIC

`DRM_CLIENT_CAP_ATOMIC ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the DRM core will expose atomic properties to userspace. This
implicitly enables [`DRM_CLIENT_CAP_UNIVERSAL_PLANES`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_CLIENT_CAP_UNIVERSAL_PLANES "DRM_CLIENT_CAP_UNIVERSAL_PLANES") and
[`DRM_CLIENT_CAP_ASPECT_RATIO`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_CLIENT_CAP_ASPECT_RATIO "DRM_CLIENT_CAP_ASPECT_RATIO").

If the driver doesn't support atomic mode-setting, enabling this capability
will fail with -EOPNOTSUPP.

This capability has been introduced in kernel version 4.0. Starting from
kernel version 4.2, this capability is always supported for atomic-capable
drivers.

DRM_CLIENT_CAP_ASPECT_RATIO

`DRM_CLIENT_CAP_ASPECT_RATIO ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the DRM core will provide aspect ratio information in modes.
See `DRM_MODE_FLAG_PIC_AR_*`.

This capability is always supported for all drivers starting from kernel
version 4.18.

DRM_CLIENT_CAP_WRITEBACK_CONNECTORS

`DRM_CLIENT_CAP_WRITEBACK_CONNECTORS ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

If set to 1, the DRM core will expose special connectors to be used for
writing back to memory the scene setup in the commit. The client must enable
[`DRM_CLIENT_CAP_ATOMIC`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_CLIENT_CAP_ATOMIC "DRM_CLIENT_CAP_ATOMIC") first.

This capability is always supported for atomic-capable drivers starting from
kernel version 4.19.

DRM_CLIENT_CAP_CURSOR_PLANE_HOTSPOT

`DRM_CLIENT_CAP_CURSOR_PLANE_HOTSPOT ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

Drivers for para-virtualized hardware (e.g. vmwgfx, qxl, virtio and
virtualbox) have additional restrictions for cursor planes (thus
making cursor planes on those drivers not truly universal,) e.g.
they need cursor planes to act like one would expect from a mouse
cursor and have correctly set hotspot properties.
If this client cap is not set the DRM core will hide cursor plane on
those virtualized drivers because not setting it implies that the
client is not capable of dealing with those extra restictions.
Clients which do set cursor hotspot and treat the cursor plane
like a mouse cursor should set this property.
The client must enable [`DRM_CLIENT_CAP_ATOMIC`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_CLIENT_CAP_ATOMIC "DRM_CLIENT_CAP_ATOMIC") first.

Setting this property on drivers which do not special case
cursor planes (i.e. non-virtualized drivers) will return
EOPNOTSUPP, which can be used by userspace to gauge
requirements of the hardware/drivers they're running on.

This capability is always supported for atomic-capable virtualized
drivers starting from kernel version 6.6.

struct drm_syncobj_eventfd

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_syncobj_eventfd {
    __u32 handle;
    __u32 flags;
    __u64 point;
    __s32 fd;
    __u32 pad;
};
```

**Members**

`handle`
:   syncobj handle.

`flags`
:   Zero to wait for the point to be signalled, or
    `DRM_SYNCOBJ_WAIT_FLAGS_WAIT_AVAILABLE` to wait for a fence to be
    available for the point.

`point`
:   syncobj timeline point (set to zero for binary syncobjs).

`fd`
:   Existing eventfd to sent events to.

`pad`
:   Must be zero.

**Description**

Register an eventfd to be signalled by a syncobj. The eventfd counter will
be incremented by one.

DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE

`DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE ()`

> Close a GEM handle.

**Parameters**

**Description**

GEM handles are not reference-counted by the kernel. User-space is
responsible for managing their lifetime. For example, if user-space imports
the same memory object twice on the same DRM file description, the same GEM
handle is returned by both imports, and user-space needs to ensure
[`DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE "DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE") is performed once only. The same situation can happen
when a memory object is allocated, then exported and imported again on the
same DRM file description. The [`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_GETFB2`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_IOCTL_MODE_GETFB2 "DRM_IOCTL_MODE_GETFB2") IOCTL is an exception
and always returns fresh new GEM handles even if an existing GEM handle
already refers to the same memory object before the IOCTL is performed.

DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_HANDLE_TO_FD

`DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_HANDLE_TO_FD ()`

> Convert a GEM handle to a DMA-BUF FD.

**Parameters**

**Description**

User-space sets `drm_prime_handle.handle` with the GEM handle to export and
`drm_prime_handle.flags`, and gets back a DMA-BUF file descriptor in
`drm_prime_handle.fd`.

The export can fail for any driver-specific reason, e.g. because export is
not supported for this specific GEM handle (but might be for others).

Support for exporting DMA-BUFs is advertised via [`DRM_PRIME_CAP_EXPORT`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_PRIME_CAP_EXPORT "DRM_PRIME_CAP_EXPORT").

DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_FD_TO_HANDLE

`DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_FD_TO_HANDLE ()`

> Convert a DMA-BUF FD to a GEM handle.

**Parameters**

**Description**

User-space sets `drm_prime_handle.fd` with a DMA-BUF file descriptor to
import, and gets back a GEM handle in `drm_prime_handle.handle`.
`drm_prime_handle.flags` is unused.

If an existing GEM handle refers to the memory object backing the DMA-BUF,
that GEM handle is returned. Therefore user-space which needs to handle
arbitrary DMA-BUFs must have a user-space lookup data structure to manually
reference-count duplicated GEM handles. For more information see
[`DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE "DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE").

The import can fail for any driver-specific reason, e.g. because import is
only supported for DMA-BUFs allocated on this DRM device.

Support for importing DMA-BUFs is advertised via [`DRM_PRIME_CAP_IMPORT`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_PRIME_CAP_IMPORT "DRM_PRIME_CAP_IMPORT").

DRM_IOCTL_MODE_RMFB

`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_RMFB ()`

> Remove a framebuffer.

**Parameters**

**Description**

This removes a framebuffer previously added via ADDFB/ADDFB2. The IOCTL
argument is a framebuffer object ID.

Warning: removing a framebuffer currently in-use on an enabled plane will
disable that plane. The CRTC the plane is linked to may also be disabled
(depending on driver capabilities).

DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB

`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB ()`

> Create a new dumb buffer object.

**Parameters**

**Description**

KMS dumb buffers provide a very primitive way to allocate a buffer object
suitable for scanout and map it for software rendering. KMS dumb buffers are
not suitable for hardware-accelerated rendering nor video decoding. KMS dumb
buffers are not suitable to be displayed on any other device than the KMS
device where they were allocated from. Also see
[Dumb Buffer Objects](drm-kms.md#kms-dumb-buffer-objects).

The IOCTL argument is a [`struct drm_mode_create_dumb`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_mode_create_dumb "drm_mode_create_dumb").

User-space is expected to create a KMS dumb buffer via this IOCTL, then add
it as a KMS framebuffer via `DRM_IOCTL_MODE_ADDFB` and map it via
`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_MAP_DUMB`.

[`DRM_CAP_DUMB_BUFFER`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_CAP_DUMB_BUFFER "DRM_CAP_DUMB_BUFFER") indicates whether this IOCTL is supported.
[`DRM_CAP_DUMB_PREFERRED_DEPTH`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_CAP_DUMB_PREFERRED_DEPTH "DRM_CAP_DUMB_PREFERRED_DEPTH") and [`DRM_CAP_DUMB_PREFER_SHADOW`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_CAP_DUMB_PREFER_SHADOW "DRM_CAP_DUMB_PREFER_SHADOW") indicate
driver preferences for dumb buffers.

DRM_IOCTL_MODE_GETFB2

`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_GETFB2 ()`

> Get framebuffer metadata.

**Parameters**

**Description**

This queries metadata about a framebuffer. User-space fills
[`drm_mode_fb_cmd2.fb_id`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_mode_fb_cmd2 "drm_mode_fb_cmd2") as the input, and the kernels fills the rest of the
struct as the output.

If the client is DRM master or has `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, [`drm_mode_fb_cmd2.handles`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_mode_fb_cmd2 "drm_mode_fb_cmd2")
will be filled with GEM buffer handles. Fresh new GEM handles are always
returned, even if another GEM handle referring to the same memory object
already exists on the DRM file description. The caller is responsible for
removing the new handles, e.g. via the [`DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE "DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE") IOCTL. The same
new handle will be returned for multiple planes in case they use the same
memory object. Planes are valid until one has a zero handle -- this can be
used to compute the number of planes.

Otherwise, [`drm_mode_fb_cmd2.handles`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_mode_fb_cmd2 "drm_mode_fb_cmd2") will be zeroed and planes are valid
until one has a zero [`drm_mode_fb_cmd2.pitches`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_mode_fb_cmd2 "drm_mode_fb_cmd2").

If the framebuffer has a format modifier, `DRM_MODE_FB_MODIFIERS` will be set
in [`drm_mode_fb_cmd2.flags`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_mode_fb_cmd2 "drm_mode_fb_cmd2") and [`drm_mode_fb_cmd2.modifier`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_mode_fb_cmd2 "drm_mode_fb_cmd2") will contain the
modifier. Otherwise, user-space must ignore [`drm_mode_fb_cmd2.modifier`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_mode_fb_cmd2 "drm_mode_fb_cmd2").

To obtain DMA-BUF FDs for each plane without leaking GEM handles, user-space
can export each handle via [`DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_HANDLE_TO_FD`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_HANDLE_TO_FD "DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_HANDLE_TO_FD"), then immediately
close each unique handle via [`DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE "DRM_IOCTL_GEM_CLOSE"), making sure to not
double-close handles which are specified multiple times in the array.

DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CLOSEFB

`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CLOSEFB ()`

> Close a framebuffer.

**Parameters**

**Description**

This closes a framebuffer previously added via ADDFB/ADDFB2. The IOCTL
argument is a framebuffer object ID.

This IOCTL is similar to [`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_RMFB`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_IOCTL_MODE_RMFB "DRM_IOCTL_MODE_RMFB"), except it doesn't disable
planes and CRTCs. As long as the framebuffer is used by a plane, it's kept
alive. When the plane no longer uses the framebuffer (because the
framebuffer is replaced with another one, or the plane is disabled), the
framebuffer is cleaned up.

This is useful to implement flicker-free transitions between two processes.

Depending on the threat model, user-space may want to ensure that the
framebuffer doesn't expose any sensitive user information: closed
framebuffers attached to a plane can be read back by the next DRM master.

struct drm_event
:   Header for DRM events

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_event {
    __u32 type;
    __u32 length;
};
```

**Members**

`type`
:   event type.

`length`
:   total number of payload bytes (including header).

**Description**

This struct is a header for events written back to user-space on the DRM FD.
A read on the DRM FD will always only return complete events: e.g. if the
read buffer is 100 bytes large and there are two 64 byte events pending,
only one will be returned.

Event types 0 - 0x7fffffff are generic DRM events, 0x80000000 and
up are chipset specific. Generic DRM events include [`DRM_EVENT_VBLANK`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_EVENT_VBLANK "DRM_EVENT_VBLANK"),
[`DRM_EVENT_FLIP_COMPLETE`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_EVENT_FLIP_COMPLETE "DRM_EVENT_FLIP_COMPLETE") and [`DRM_EVENT_CRTC_SEQUENCE`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_EVENT_CRTC_SEQUENCE "DRM_EVENT_CRTC_SEQUENCE").

and call the ioctl. **count_format_types** will be updated with the value.

To retrieve these formats, allocate an array with the memory needed to store
**count_format_types** formats. Point **format_type_ptr** to this array and call
the ioctl again (with **count_format_types** still set to the value returned in
the first ioctl call).

    This is not an object ID. This is a per-type connector number. Each
    (type, type_id) combination is unique across all connectors of a DRM
    device.

    The (type, type_id) combination is not a stable identifier: the
    type_id can change depending on the driver probe order.

`connection`
:   Status of the connector.

    See [`enum drm_connector_status`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_connector_status "drm_connector_status").

`mm_width`
:   Width of the connected sink in millimeters.

`mm_height`
:   Height of the connected sink in millimeters.

`subpixel`
:   Subpixel order of the connected sink.

    See enum subpixel_order.

`pad`
:   Padding, must be zero.

**Description**

User-space can perform a GETCONNECTOR ioctl to retrieve information about a
connector. User-space is expected to retrieve encoders, modes and properties
by performing this ioctl at least twice: the first time to retrieve the
number of elements, the second time to retrieve the elements themselves.

To retrieve the number of elements, set **count_props** and **count_encoders** to
zero, set **count_modes** to 1, and set **modes_ptr** to a temporary [`struct
drm_mode_modeinfo`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_mode_modeinfo "drm_mode_modeinfo") element.

To retrieve the elements, allocate arrays for **encoders_ptr**, **modes_ptr**,
**props_ptr** and **prop_values_ptr**, then set **count_modes**, **count_props** and
**count_encoders** to their capacity.

Performing the ioctl only twice may be racy: the number of elements may have
changed with a hotplug event in-between the two ioctls. User-space is
expected to retry the last ioctl until the number of elements stabilizes.
The kernel won't fill any array which doesn't have the expected length.

**Force-probing a connector**

If the **count_modes** field is set to zero and the DRM client is the current
DRM master, the kernel will perform a forced probe on the connector to
refresh the connector status, modes and EDID. A forced-probe can be slow,
might cause flickering and the ioctl will block.

User-space needs to force-probe connectors to ensure their metadata is
up-to-date at startup and after receiving a hot-plug event. User-space
may perform a forced-probe when the user explicitly requests it. User-space
shouldn't perform a forced-probe in other situations.

struct drm_mode_property_enum
:   Description for an enum/bitfield entry.

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_mode_property_enum {
    __u64 value;
    char name[DRM_PROP_NAME_LEN];
};
```

**Members**

`value`
:   numeric value for this enum entry.

`name`
:   symbolic name for this enum entry.

**Description**

See [`struct drm_property_enum`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_property_enum "drm_property_enum") for details.

struct drm_mode_get_property
:   Get property metadata.

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_mode_get_property {
    __u64 values_ptr;
    __u64 enum_blob_ptr;
    __u32 prop_id;
    __u32 flags;
    char name[DRM_PROP_NAME_LEN];
    __u32 count_values;
    __u32 count_enum_blobs;
};
```

**Members**

`values_ptr`
:   Pointer to a `__u64` array.

`enum_blob_ptr`
:   Pointer to a [`struct drm_mode_property_enum`](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_mode_property_enum "drm_mode_property_enum") array.

`prop_id`
:   Object ID of the property which should be retrieved. Set
    by the caller.

`flags`
:   `DRM_MODE_PROP_*` bitfield. See [`drm_property.flags`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_property "drm_property") for
    a definition of the flags.

`name`
:   Symbolic property name. User-space should use this field to
    recognize properties.

`count_values`
:   Number of elements in **values_ptr**.

`count_enum_blobs`
:   Number of elements in **enum_blob_ptr**.

**Description**

User-space can perform a GETPROPERTY ioctl to retrieve information about a
property. The same property may be attached to multiple objects, see
"Modeset Base Object Abstraction".

The meaning of the **values_ptr** field changes depending on the property type.
See [`drm_property.flags`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_property "drm_property") for more details.

The **enum_blob_ptr** and **count_enum_blobs** fields are only meaningful when the
property has the type `DRM_MODE_PROP_ENUM` or `DRM_MODE_PROP_BITMASK`. For
backwards compatibility, the kernel will always set **count_enum_blobs** to
zero when the property has the type `DRM_MODE_PROP_BLOB`. User-space must
ignore these two fields if the property has a different type.

User-space is expected to retrieve values and enums by performing this ioctl
at least twice: the first time to retrieve the number of elements, the
second time to retrieve the elements themselves.

To retrieve the number of elements, set **count_values** and **count_enum_blobs**
to zero, then call the ioctl. **count_values** will be updated with the number
of elements. If the property has the type `DRM_MODE_PROP_ENUM` or
`DRM_MODE_PROP_BITMASK`, **count_enum_blobs** will be updated as well.

To retrieve the elements themselves, allocate an array for **values_ptr** and
set **count_values** to its capacity. If the property has the type
`DRM_MODE_PROP_ENUM` or `DRM_MODE_PROP_BITMASK`, allocate an array for
**enum_blob_ptr** and set **count_enum_blobs** to its capacity. Calling the ioctl
again will fill the arrays.

struct drm_mode_fb_cmd2
:   Frame-buffer metadata.

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_mode_fb_cmd2 {
    __u32 fb_id;
    __u32 width;
    __u32 height;
    __u32 pixel_format;
    __u32 flags;
    __u32 handles[4];
    __u32 pitches[4];
    __u32 offsets[4];
    __u64 modifier[4];
};
```

**Members**

`fb_id`
:   Object ID of the frame-buffer.

`width`
:   Width of the frame-buffer.

`height`
:   Height of the frame-buffer.

`pixel_format`
:   FourCC format code, see `DRM_FORMAT_*` constants in
    `drm_fourcc.h`.

`flags`
:   Frame-buffer flags (see `DRM_MODE_FB_INTERLACED` and
    `DRM_MODE_FB_MODIFIERS`).

`handles`
:   GEM buffer handle, one per plane. Set to 0 if the plane is
    unused. The same handle can be used for multiple planes.

`pitches`
:   Pitch (aka. stride) in bytes, one per plane.

`offsets`
:   Offset into the buffer in bytes, one per plane.

`modifier`
:   Format modifier, one per plane. See `DRM_FORMAT_MOD_*`
    constants in `drm_fourcc.h`. All planes must use the same
    modifier. Ignored unless `DRM_MODE_FB_MODIFIERS` is set in **flags**.

**Description**

This struct holds frame-buffer metadata. There are two ways to use it:

- User-space can fill this struct and perform a `DRM_IOCTL_MODE_ADDFB2`
  ioctl to register a new frame-buffer. The new frame-buffer object ID will
  be set by the kernel in **fb_id**.
- User-space can set **fb_id** and perform a [`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_GETFB2`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_IOCTL_MODE_GETFB2 "DRM_IOCTL_MODE_GETFB2") ioctl to
  fetch metadata about an existing frame-buffer.

In case of planar formats, this struct allows up to 4 buffer objects with
offsets and pitches per plane. The pitch and offset order are dictated by
the format FourCC as defined by `drm_fourcc.h`, e.g. NV12 is described as:

> YUV 4:2:0 image with a plane of 8-bit Y samples followed by an
> interleaved U/V plane containing 8-bit 2x2 subsampled colour difference
> samples.

So it would consist of a Y plane at `offsets[0]` and a UV plane at
`offsets[1]`.

To accommodate tiled, compressed, etc formats, a modifier can be specified.
For more information see the "Format Modifiers" section. Note that even
though it looks like we have a modifier per-plane, we in fact do not. The
modifier for each plane must be identical. Thus all combinations of
different data layouts for multi-plane formats must be enumerated as
separate modifiers.

All of the entries in **handles**, **pitches**, **offsets** and **modifier** must be
zero when unused. Warning, for **offsets** and **modifier** zero can't be used to
figure out whether the entry is used or not since it's a valid value (a zero
offset is common, and a zero modifier is `DRM_FORMAT_MOD_LINEAR`).

DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_EVENT

`DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_EVENT ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

Request that the kernel sends back a vblank event (see
struct drm_event_vblank) with the [`DRM_EVENT_FLIP_COMPLETE`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_EVENT_FLIP_COMPLETE "DRM_EVENT_FLIP_COMPLETE") type when the
page-flip is done.

DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_ASYNC

`DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_ASYNC ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

Request that the page-flip is performed as soon as possible, ie. with no
delay due to waiting for vblank. This may cause tearing to be visible on
the screen.

When used with atomic uAPI, the driver will return an error if the hardware
doesn't support performing an asynchronous page-flip for this update.
User-space should handle this, e.g. by falling back to a regular page-flip.

Note, some hardware might need to perform one last synchronous page-flip
before being able to switch to asynchronous page-flips. As an exception,
the driver will return success even though that first page-flip is not
asynchronous.

DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_FLAGS

`DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_FLAGS ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

Bitmask of flags suitable for `drm_mode_crtc_page_flip_target.flags`.

struct drm_mode_create_dumb
:   Create a KMS dumb buffer for scanout.

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_mode_create_dumb {
    __u32 height;
    __u32 width;
    __u32 bpp;
    __u32 flags;
    __u32 handle;
    __u32 pitch;
    __u64 size;
};
```

**Members**

`height`
:   buffer height in pixels

`width`
:   buffer width in pixels

`bpp`
:   bits per pixel

`flags`
:   must be zero

`handle`
:   buffer object handle

`pitch`
:   number of bytes between two consecutive lines

`size`
:   size of the whole buffer in bytes

**Description**

User-space fills **height**, **width**, **bpp** and **flags**. If the IOCTL succeeds,
the kernel fills **handle**, **pitch** and **size**.

DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_TEST_ONLY

`DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_TEST_ONLY ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

Do not apply the atomic commit, instead check whether the hardware supports
this configuration.

See [`drm_mode_config_funcs.atomic_check`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_mode_config_funcs "drm_mode_config_funcs") for more details on test-only
commits.

DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_NONBLOCK

`DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_NONBLOCK ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

Do not block while applying the atomic commit. The `DRM_IOCTL_MODE_ATOMIC`
IOCTL returns immediately instead of waiting for the changes to be applied
in hardware. Note, the driver will still check that the update can be
applied before retuning.

DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_ALLOW_MODESET

`DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_ALLOW_MODESET ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

Allow the update to result in temporary or transient visible artifacts while
the update is being applied. Applying the update may also take significantly
more time than a page flip. All visual artifacts will disappear by the time
the update is completed, as signalled through the vblank event's timestamp
(see struct drm_event_vblank).

This flag must be set when the KMS update might cause visible artifacts.
Without this flag such KMS update will return a EINVAL error. What kind of
update may cause visible artifacts depends on the driver and the hardware.
User-space that needs to know beforehand if an update might cause visible
artifacts can use [`DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_TEST_ONLY`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_TEST_ONLY "DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_TEST_ONLY") without
[`DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_ALLOW_MODESET`](drm-uapi.md#c.DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_ALLOW_MODESET "DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_ALLOW_MODESET") to see if it fails.

To the best of the driver's knowledge, visual artifacts are guaranteed to
not appear when this flag is not set. Some sinks might display visual
artifacts outside of the driver's control.

DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_FLAGS

`DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_FLAGS ()`

**Parameters**

**Description**

Bitfield of flags accepted by the `DRM_IOCTL_MODE_ATOMIC` IOCTL in
`drm_mode_atomic.flags`.

atomic commit and you will not make another commit re-using the same ID, you
can destroy the blob as soon as the commit has been issued, without waiting
for it to complete.
