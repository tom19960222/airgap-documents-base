# DRM Memory Management

Modern Linux systems require large amount of graphics memory to store
frame buffers, textures, vertices and other graphics-related data. Given
the very dynamic nature of many of that data, managing graphics memory
efficiently is thus crucial for the graphics stack and plays a central
role in the DRM infrastructure.

The DRM core includes two memory managers, namely Translation Table Manager
(TTM) and Graphics Execution Manager (GEM). TTM was the first DRM memory
manager to be developed and tried to be a one-size-fits-them all
solution. It provides a single userspace API to accommodate the need of
all hardware, supporting both Unified Memory Architecture (UMA) devices
and devices with dedicated video RAM (i.e. most discrete video cards).
This resulted in a large, complex piece of code that turned out to be
hard to use for driver development.

GEM started as an Intel-sponsored project in reaction to TTM's
complexity. Its design philosophy is completely different: instead of
providing a solution to every graphics memory-related problems, GEM
identified common code between drivers and created a support library to
share it. GEM has simpler initialization and execution requirements than
TTM, but has no video RAM management capabilities and is thus limited to
UMA devices.

## The Translation Table Manager (TTM)

TTM is a memory manager for accelerator devices with dedicated memory.

The basic idea is that resources are grouped together in buffer objects of
certain size and TTM handles lifetime, movement and CPU mappings of those
objects.

TODO: Add more design background and information here.

enum ttm_caching
:   CPU caching and BUS snooping behavior.

**Constants**

`ttm_uncached`
:   Most defensive option for device mappings,
    don't even allow write combining.

`ttm_write_combined`
:   Don't cache read accesses, but allow at least
    writes to be combined.

`ttm_cached`
:   Fully cached like normal system memory, requires that
    devices snoop the CPU cache on accesses.

### TTM TT object reference

struct ttm_tt
:   This is a structure holding the pages, caching- and aperture binding status for a buffer object that isn't backed by fixed (VRAM / AGP) memory.

**Definition**:

```
struct ttm_tt {
    struct page **pages;
#define TTM_TT_FLAG_SWAPPED             BIT(0);
#define TTM_TT_FLAG_ZERO_ALLOC          BIT(1);
#define TTM_TT_FLAG_EXTERNAL            BIT(2);
#define TTM_TT_FLAG_EXTERNAL_MAPPABLE   BIT(3);
#define TTM_TT_FLAG_PRIV_POPULATED      BIT(4);
    uint32_t page_flags;
    uint32_t num_pages;
    struct sg_table *sg;
    dma_addr_t *dma_address;
    struct file *swap_storage;
    enum ttm_caching caching;
};
```

**Members**

`pages`
:   Array of pages backing the data.

`page_flags`
:   The page flags.

    Supported values:

    TTM_TT_FLAG_SWAPPED: Set by TTM when the pages have been unpopulated
    and swapped out by TTM. Calling [`ttm_tt_populate()`](drm-mm.md#c.ttm_tt_populate "ttm_tt_populate") will then swap the
    pages back in, and unset the flag. Drivers should in general never
    need to touch this.

    TTM_TT_FLAG_ZERO_ALLOC: Set if the pages will be zeroed on
    allocation.

    TTM_TT_FLAG_EXTERNAL: Set if the underlying pages were allocated
    externally, like with dma-buf or userptr. This effectively disables
    TTM swapping out such pages. Also important is to prevent TTM from
    ever directly mapping these pages.

    Note that enum ttm_bo_type.ttm_bo_type_sg objects will always enable
    this flag.

    TTM_TT_FLAG_EXTERNAL_MAPPABLE: Same behaviour as
    TTM_TT_FLAG_EXTERNAL, but with the reduced restriction that it is
    still valid to use TTM to map the pages directly. This is useful when
    implementing a ttm_tt backend which still allocates driver owned
    pages underneath(say with shmem).

    Note that since this also implies TTM_TT_FLAG_EXTERNAL, the usage
    here should always be:

    > page_flags = TTM_TT_FLAG_EXTERNAL |
    > :   TTM_TT_FLAG_EXTERNAL_MAPPABLE;

    TTM_TT_FLAG_PRIV_POPULATED: TTM internal only. DO NOT USE. This is
    set by TTM after [`ttm_tt_populate()`](drm-mm.md#c.ttm_tt_populate "ttm_tt_populate") has successfully returned, and is
    then unset when TTM calls [`ttm_tt_unpopulate()`](drm-mm.md#c.ttm_tt_unpopulate "ttm_tt_unpopulate").

`num_pages`
:   Number of pages in the page array.

`sg`
:   for SG objects via dma-buf.

`dma_address`
:   The DMA (bus) addresses of the pages.

`swap_storage`

:   Specialization of a mappig iterator for a tt.

## The Graphics Execution Manager (GEM)

The GEM design approach has resulted in a memory manager that doesn't
provide full coverage of all (or even all common) use cases in its
userspace or kernel API. GEM exposes a set of standard memory-related
operations to userspace and a set of helper functions to drivers, and
let drivers implement hardware-specific operations with their own
private API.

The GEM userspace API is described in the [GEM - the Graphics Execution
Manager](http://lwn.net/Articles/283798/) article on LWN. While
slightly outdated, the document provides a good overview of the GEM API
principles. Buffer allocation and read and write operations, described
as part of the common GEM API, are currently implemented using
driver-specific ioctls.

GEM is data-agnostic. It manages abstract buffer objects without knowing
what individual buffers contain. APIs that require knowledge of buffer
contents or purpose, such as buffer allocation or synchronization
primitives, are thus outside of the scope of GEM and must be implemented
using driver-specific ioctls.

On a fundamental level, GEM involves several operations:

- Memory allocation and freeing
- Command execution
- Aperture management at command execution time

Buffer object allocation is relatively straightforward and largely
provided by Linux's shmem layer, which provides memory to back each
object.

Device-specific operations, such as command execution, pinning, buffer
read & write, mapping, and domain ownership transfers are left to
driver-specific ioctls.

### GEM Initialization

Drivers that use GEM must set the DRIVER_GEM bit in the struct
[`struct drm_driver`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") driver_features
field. The DRM core will then automatically initialize the GEM core
before calling the load operation. Behind the scene, this will create a
DRM Memory Manager object which provides an address space pool for
object allocation.

In a KMS configuration, drivers need to allocate and initialize a
command ring buffer following core GEM initialization if required by the
hardware. UMA devices usually have what is called a "stolen" memory
region, which provides space for the initial framebuffer and large,
contiguous memory regions required by the device. This space is
typically not managed by GEM, and must be initialized separately into
its own DRM MM object.

### GEM Objects Creation

GEM splits creation of GEM objects and allocation of the memory that
backs them in two distinct operations.

GEM objects are represented by an instance of struct [`struct
drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object"). Drivers usually need to
extend GEM objects with private information and thus create a
driver-specific GEM object structure type that embeds an instance of
struct [`struct drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object").

To create a GEM object, a driver allocates memory for an instance of its
specific GEM object type and initializes the embedded struct
[`struct drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") with a call
to [`drm_gem_object_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_init "drm_gem_object_init"). The function takes a pointer
to the DRM device, a pointer to the GEM object and the buffer object
size in bytes.

GEM uses shmem to allocate anonymous pageable memory.
[`drm_gem_object_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_init "drm_gem_object_init") will create an shmfs file of the
requested size and store it into the struct [`struct
drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") filp field. The memory is
used as either main storage for the object when the graphics hardware
uses system memory directly or as a backing store otherwise.

Drivers are responsible for the actual physical pages allocation by
calling shmem_read_mapping_page_gfp() for each page.
Note that they can decide to allocate pages when initializing the GEM
object, or to delay allocation until the memory is needed (for instance
when a page fault occurs as a result of a userspace memory access or
when the driver needs to start a DMA transfer involving the memory).

Anonymous pageable memory allocation is not always desired, for instance
when the hardware requires physically contiguous system memory as is
often the case in embedded devices. Drivers can create GEM objects with
no shmfs backing (called private GEM objects) by initializing them with a call
to [`drm_gem_private_object_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_private_object_init "drm_gem_private_object_init") instead of [`drm_gem_object_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_init "drm_gem_object_init"). Storage for
private GEM objects must be managed by drivers.

### GEM Objects Lifetime

All GEM objects are reference-counted by the GEM core. References can be
acquired and release by calling [`drm_gem_object_get()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_get "drm_gem_object_get") and [`drm_gem_object_put()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_put "drm_gem_object_put")
respectively.

When the last reference to a GEM object is released the GEM core calls
the `struct drm_gem_object_funcs` free
operation. That operation is mandatory for GEM-enabled drivers and must
free the GEM object and all associated resources.

void (\*free) ([`struct drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj); Drivers are
responsible for freeing all GEM object resources. This includes the
resources created by the GEM core, which need to be released with
[`drm_gem_object_release()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_release "drm_gem_object_release").

### GEM Objects Naming

Communication between userspace and the kernel refers to GEM objects
using local handles, global names or, more recently, file descriptors.
All of those are 32-bit integer values; the usual Linux kernel limits
apply to the file descriptors.

GEM handles are local to a DRM file. Applications get a handle to a GEM
object through a driver-specific ioctl, and can use that handle to refer
to the GEM object in other standard or driver-specific ioctls. Closing a
DRM file handle frees all its GEM handles and dereferences the
associated GEM objects.

To create a handle for a GEM object drivers call [`drm_gem_handle_create()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_handle_create "drm_gem_handle_create"). The
function takes a pointer to the DRM file and the GEM object and returns a
locally unique handle. When the handle is no longer needed drivers delete it
with a call to [`drm_gem_handle_delete()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_handle_delete "drm_gem_handle_delete"). Finally the GEM object associated with a
handle can be retrieved by a call to [`drm_gem_object_lookup()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_lookup "drm_gem_object_lookup").

Handles don't take ownership of GEM objects, they only take a reference
to the object that will be dropped when the handle is destroyed. To
avoid leaking GEM objects, drivers must make sure they drop the
reference(s) they own (such as the initial reference taken at object
creation time) as appropriate, without any special consideration for the
handle. For example, in the particular case of combined GEM object and
handle creation in the implementation of the dumb_create operation,
drivers must drop the initial reference to the GEM object before
returning the handle.

GEM names are similar in purpose to handles but are not local to DRM
files. They can be passed between processes to reference a GEM object
globally. Names can't be used directly to refer to objects in the DRM
API, applications must convert handles to names and names to handles
using the DRM_IOCTL_GEM_FLINK and DRM_IOCTL_GEM_OPEN ioctls
respectively. The conversion is handled by the DRM core without any
driver-specific support.

GEM also supports buffer sharing with dma-buf file descriptors through
PRIME. GEM-based drivers must use the provided helpers functions to
implement the exporting and importing correctly. See ?. Since sharing
file descriptors is inherently more secure than the easily guessable and
global GEM names it is the preferred buffer sharing mechanism. Sharing
buffers through GEM names is only supported for legacy userspace.
Furthermore PRIME also allows cross-device buffer sharing since it is
based on dma-bufs.

### GEM Objects Mapping

Because mapping operations are fairly heavyweight GEM favours
read/write-like access to buffers, implemented through driver-specific
ioctls, over mapping buffers to userspace. However, when random access
to the buffer is needed (to perform software rendering for instance),
direct access to the object can be more efficient.

The mmap system call can't be used directly to map GEM objects, as they
don't have their own file handle. Two alternative methods currently
co-exist to map GEM objects to userspace. The first method uses a
driver-specific ioctl to perform the mapping operation, calling
do_mmap() under the hood. This is often considered
dubious, seems to be discouraged for new GEM-enabled drivers, and will
thus not be described here.

The second method uses the mmap system call on the DRM file handle. void
\*mmap(void \*addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t
offset); DRM identifies the GEM object to be mapped by a fake offset
passed through the mmap offset argument. Prior to being mapped, a GEM
object must thus be associated with a fake offset. To do so, drivers
must call [`drm_gem_create_mmap_offset()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_create_mmap_offset "drm_gem_create_mmap_offset") on the object.

Once allocated, the fake offset value must be passed to the application
in a driver-specific way and can then be used as the mmap offset
argument.

The GEM core provides a helper method [`drm_gem_mmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_mmap "drm_gem_mmap") to
handle object mapping. The method can be set directly as the mmap file
operation handler. It will look up the GEM object based on the offset
value and set the VMA operations to the [`struct drm_driver`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") gem_vm_ops field. Note that [`drm_gem_mmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_mmap "drm_gem_mmap") doesn't map memory to
userspace, but relies on the driver-provided fault handler to map pages
individually.

To use [`drm_gem_mmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_mmap "drm_gem_mmap"), drivers must fill the struct [`struct drm_driver`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") gem_vm_ops field with a pointer to VM operations.

The VM operations is a `struct vm_operations_struct`
made up of several fields, the more interesting ones being:

```c
struct vm_operations_struct {
        void (*open)(struct vm_area_struct * area);
        void (*close)(struct vm_area_struct * area);
        vm_fault_t (*fault)(struct vm_fault *vmf);
};
```

The open and close operations must update the GEM object reference
count. Drivers can use the [`drm_gem_vm_open()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vm_open "drm_gem_vm_open") and [`drm_gem_vm_close()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vm_close "drm_gem_vm_close") helper
functions directly as open and close handlers.

The fault operation handler is responsible for mapping individual pages
to userspace when a page fault occurs. Depending on the memory
allocation scheme, drivers can allocate pages at fault time, or can
decide to allocate memory for the GEM object at the time the object is
created.

Drivers that want to map the GEM object upfront instead of handling page
faults can implement their own mmap file operation handler.

For platforms without MMU the GEM core provides a helper method
[`drm_gem_dma_get_unmapped_area()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dma_get_unmapped_area "drm_gem_dma_get_unmapped_area"). The mmap() routines will call this to get a
proposed address for the mapping.

To use [`drm_gem_dma_get_unmapped_area()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dma_get_unmapped_area "drm_gem_dma_get_unmapped_area"), drivers must fill the struct
`struct file_operations` get_unmapped_area field with
a pointer on [`drm_gem_dma_get_unmapped_area()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dma_get_unmapped_area "drm_gem_dma_get_unmapped_area").

More detailed information about get_unmapped_area can be found in
[No-MMU memory mapping support](../admin-guide/mm/nommu-mmap.md)

### Memory Coherency

When mapped to the device or used in a command buffer, backing pages for
an object are flushed to memory and marked write combined so as to be
coherent with the GPU. Likewise, if the CPU accesses an object after the
GPU has finished rendering to the object, then the object must be made
coherent with the CPU's view of memory, usually involving GPU cache
flushing of various kinds. This core CPU<->GPU coherency management is
provided by a device-specific ioctl, which evaluates an object's current
domain and performs any necessary flushing or synchronization to put the
object into the desired coherency domain (note that the object may be
busy, i.e. an active render target; in that case, setting the domain
blocks the client and waits for rendering to complete before performing
any necessary flushing operations).

### Command Execution

Perhaps the most important GEM function for GPU devices is providing a
command execution interface to clients. Client programs construct
command buffers containing references to previously allocated memory
objects, and then submit them to GEM. At that point, GEM takes care to
bind all the objects into the GTT, execute the buffer, and provide
necessary synchronization between clients accessing the same buffers.
This often involves evicting some objects from the GTT and re-binding
others (a fairly expensive operation), and providing relocation support
which hides fixed GTT offsets from clients. Clients must take care not
to submit command buffers that reference more objects than can fit in
the GTT; otherwise, GEM will reject them and no rendering will occur.
Similarly, if several objects in the buffer require fence registers to
be allocated for correct rendering (e.g. 2D blits on pre-965 chips),
care must be taken not to require more fence registers than are
available to the client. Such resource management should be abstracted
from the client in libdrm.

### GEM Function Reference

enum drm_gem_object_status
:   bitmask of object state for fdinfo reporting

**Constants**

`DRM_GEM_OBJECT_RESIDENT`
:   object is resident in memory (ie. not unpinned)

`DRM_GEM_OBJECT_PURGEABLE`
:   object marked as purgeable by userspace

**Description**

Bitmask of status used for fdinfo memory stats, see [`drm_gem_object_funcs.status`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_funcs "drm_gem_object_funcs")
and [`drm_show_fdinfo()`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_show_fdinfo "drm_show_fdinfo"). Note that an object can DRM_GEM_OBJECT_PURGEABLE if
it still active or not resident, in which case [`drm_show_fdinfo()`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_show_fdinfo "drm_show_fdinfo") will not
account for it as purgeable. So drivers do not need to check if the buffer
is idle and resident to return this bit. (Ie. userspace can mark a buffer
as purgeable even while it is still busy on the GPU.. it does not _actually_
become puregeable until it becomes idle. The status gem object func does
not need to consider this.)

struct drm_gem_object_funcs

    Used when exporting a buffer by the [`drm_gem_map_dma_buf()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_map_dma_buf "drm_gem_map_dma_buf") helper.
    Releasing is done by calling dma_unmap_sg_attrs() and sg_free_table()
    in drm_gem_unmap_buf(), therefore these helpers and this callback
    here cannot be used for sg tables pointing at driver private memory

    helper. Returns 0 on success, -errno otherwise.

    This callback is optional.

`status`
:   The optional status callback can return additional object state
    which determines which stats the object is counted against. The
    callback is called under table_lock. Racing against object status
    change is "harmless", and the callback can expect to not race
    against object destruction.

    Called by [`drm_show_memory_stats()`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_show_memory_stats "drm_show_memory_stats").

`rss`

**Members**

`refcount`
:   Reference count of this object

    Please use [`drm_gem_object_get()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_get "drm_gem_object_get") to acquire and drm_gem_object_put_locked()
    or [`drm_gem_object_put()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_put "drm_gem_object_put") to release a reference to a GEM
    buffer object.

`handle_count`
:   This is the GEM file_priv handle count of this object.

    Each handle also holds a reference. Note that when the handle_count
    drops to 0 any global names (e.g. the id in the flink namespace) will
    be cleared.

    Protected by [`drm_device.object_name_lock`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device").

`dev`
:   DRM dev this object belongs to.

`filp`
:   SHMEM file node used as backing storage for swappable buffer objects.
    GEM also supports driver private objects with driver-specific backing
    storage (contiguous DMA memory, special reserved blocks). In this
    case **filp** is NULL.

`vma_node`
:   Mapping info for this object to support mmap. Drivers are supposed to
    allocate the mmap offset using [`drm_gem_create_mmap_offset()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_create_mmap_offset "drm_gem_create_mmap_offset"). The
    offset itself can be retrieved using [`drm_vma_node_offset_addr()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_node_offset_addr "drm_vma_node_offset_addr").

    Memory mapping itself is handled by [`drm_gem_mmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_mmap "drm_gem_mmap"), which also checks
    that userspace is allowed to access the object.

`size`
:   Size of the object, in bytes. Immutable over the object's
    lifetime.

`name`
:   Global name for this object, starts at 1. 0 means unnamed.
    Access is covered by [`drm_device.object_name_lock`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device"). This is used by
    the GEM_FLINK and GEM_OPEN ioctls.

`dma_buf`
:   dma-buf associated with this GEM object.

    Pointer to the dma-buf associated with this gem object (either
    through importing or exporting). We break the resulting reference
    loop when the last gem handle for this object is released.

    Protected by [`drm_device.object_name_lock`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device").

`import_attach`
:   dma-buf attachment backing this object.

    Any foreign dma_buf imported as a gem object has this set to the
    attachment point for the device. This is invariant over the lifetime
    of a gem object.

    The [`drm_gem_object_funcs.free`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_funcs "drm_gem_object_funcs") callback is responsible for
    cleaning up the dma_buf attachment and references acquired at import
    time.

    Note that the drm gem/prime core does not depend upon drivers setting
    this field any more. So for drivers where this doesn't make sense
    (e.g. virtual devices or a displaylink behind an usb bus) they can
    simply leave it as NULL.

`resv`
:   Pointer to reservation object associated with the this GEM object.

    Normally (**resv** == &\*\*_resv\*\*) except for imported GEM objects.

`_resv`
:   A reservation object for this GEM object.

    This is unused for imported GEM objects.

`gpuva`
:   Provides the list of GPU VAs attached to this GEM object.

    Drivers should lock list accesses with the GEMs [`dma_resv`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_resv "dma_resv") lock
    ([`drm_gem_object.resv`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object")) or a custom lock if one is provided.

`funcs`
:   Optional GEM object functions. If this is set, it will be used instead of the
    corresponding [`drm_driver`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") GEM callbacks.

    New drivers should use this.

`lru_node`
:   List node in a [`drm_gem_lru`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_lru "drm_gem_lru").

`lru`
:   The current LRU list that the GEM object is on.

**Description**

This structure defines the generic parts for GEM buffer objects, which are
mostly around handling mmap and userspace handles.

Buffer objects are often abbreviated to BO.

DRM_GEM_FOPS

`DRM_GEM_FOPS ()`

> Default drm GEM file operations

**Parameters**

**Description**

This macro provides a shorthand for setting the GEM file ops in the
`file_operations` structure. If all you need are the default ops, use
DEFINE_DRM_GEM_FOPS instead.

DEFINE_DRM_GEM_FOPS

`DEFINE_DRM_GEM_FOPS (name)`

> macro to generate file operations for GEM drivers

**Parameters**

`name`
:   name for the generated structure

**Description**

This macro autogenerates a suitable `struct file_operations` for GEM based
drivers, which can be assigned to [`drm_driver.fops`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver"). Note that this structure
cannot be shared between drivers, because it contains a reference to the
current module using THIS_MODULE.

Note that the declaration is already marked as static - if you need a
non-static version of this you're probably doing it wrong and will break the
THIS_MODULE reference by accident.

void drm_gem_object_get(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj)
:   acquire a GEM buffer object reference

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   GEM buffer object

**Description**

This function acquires an additional reference to **obj**. It is illegal to
call this without already holding a reference. No locks required.

void drm_gem_object_put(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj)
:   drop a GEM buffer object reference

**Parameters**

> Set the lock protecting accesses to the gpuva list.

**Parameters**

`obj`
:   the [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object")

`lock`
:   the lock used to protect the gpuva list. The locking primitive
    must contain a dep_map field.

**Description**

Call this if you're not proctecting access to the gpuva list with the
dma-resv lock, but with a custom lock.

void drm_gem_gpuva_init(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj)
:   initialize the gpuva list of a GEM object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   the [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object")

**Description**

This initializes the [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object")'s [`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") list.

Calling this function is only necessary for drivers intending to support the
[`drm_driver_feature`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver_feature "drm_driver_feature") DRIVER_GEM_GPUVA.

See also [`drm_gem_gpuva_set_lock()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_gpuva_set_lock "drm_gem_gpuva_set_lock").

drm_gem_for_each_gpuvm_bo

`drm_gem_for_each_gpuvm_bo (entry__, obj__)`

> iterator to walk over a list of [`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo")

**Parameters**

`entry__`
:   [`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") structure to assign to in each iteration step

`obj__`
:   the [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") the [`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") to walk are associated with

**Description**

This iterator walks over all [`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") structures associated with the
[`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object").

drm_gem_for_each_gpuvm_bo_safe

`drm_gem_for_each_gpuvm_bo_safe (entry__, next__, obj__)`

> iterator to safely walk over a list of [`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo")

**Parameters**

`entry__`
:   `drm_gpuvm_bostructure` to assign to in each iteration step

`next__`
:   `next` [`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") to store the next step

`obj__`
:   the [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") the [`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") to walk are associated with

**Description**

This iterator walks over all [`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") structures associated with the
[`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object"). It is implemented with [`list_for_each_entry_safe()`](../core-api/kernel-api.md#c.list_for_each_entry_safe "list_for_each_entry_safe"), hence
it is save against removal of elements.

int drm_gem_object_init(struct [drm_device](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") \*dev, struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj, size_t size)
:   initialize an allocated shmem-backed GEM object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_device *dev`
:   drm_device the object should be initialized for

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   drm_gem_object to initialize

`size_t size`
:   object size

**Description**

Initialize an already allocated GEM object of the specified size with
shmfs backing store.

void drm_gem_private_object_init(struct [drm_device](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") \*dev, struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj, size_t size)
:   initialize an allocated private GEM object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_device *dev`
:   drm_device the object should be initialized for

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   drm_gem_object to initialize

`size_t size`
:   object size

**Description**

Initialize an already allocated GEM object of the specified size with
no GEM provided backing store. Instead the caller is responsible for
backing the object and handling it.

void drm_gem_private_object_fini(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj)
:   Finalize a failed drm_gem_object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   drm_gem_object

**Description**

Uninitialize an already allocated GEM object when it initialized failed

int drm_gem_handle_delete(struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*filp, u32 handle)
:   deletes the given file-private handle

**Parameters**

`struct drm_file *filp`
:   drm file-private structure to use for the handle look up

`u32 handle`
:   userspace handle to delete

**Description**

Removes the GEM handle from the **filp** lookup table which has been added with
[`drm_gem_handle_create()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_handle_create "drm_gem_handle_create"). If this is the last handle also cleans up linked
resources like GEM names.

int drm_gem_dumb_map_offset(struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*file, struct [drm_device](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") \*dev, u32 handle, u64 \*offset)
:   return the fake mmap offset for a gem object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_file *file`
:   drm file-private structure containing the gem object

`struct drm_device *dev`
:   corresponding drm_device

`u32 handle`
:   gem object handle

`u64 *offset`
:   return location for the fake mmap offset

**Description**

This implements the [`drm_driver.dumb_map_offset`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") kms driver callback for
drivers which use gem to manage their backing storage.

**Return**

0 on success or a negative error code on failure.

int drm_gem_handle_create(struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*file_priv, struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj, u32 \*handlep)
:   create a gem handle for an object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_file *file_priv`
:   drm file-private structure to register the handle for

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   object to register

`u32 *handlep`
:   pointer to return the created handle to the caller

**Description**

Create a handle for this object. This adds a handle reference to the object,
which includes a regular reference count. Callers will likely want to
dereference the object afterwards.

Since this publishes **obj** to userspace it must be fully set up by this point,
drivers must call this last in their buffer object creation callbacks.

void drm_gem_free_mmap_offset(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj)
:   release a fake mmap offset for an object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   obj in question

**Description**

This routine frees fake offsets allocated by [`drm_gem_create_mmap_offset()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_create_mmap_offset "drm_gem_create_mmap_offset").

Note that [`drm_gem_object_release()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_release "drm_gem_object_release") already calls this function, so drivers
don't have to take care of releasing the mmap offset themselves when freeing
the GEM object.

int drm_gem_create_mmap_offset_size(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj, size_t size)
:   create a fake mmap offset for an object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   obj in question

`size_t size`
:   the virtual size

**Description**

GEM memory mapping works by handing back to userspace a fake mmap offset
it can use in a subsequent mmap(2) call. The DRM core code then looks
up the object based on the offset and sets up the various memory mapping
structures.

This routine allocates and attaches a fake offset for **obj**, in cases where
the virtual size differs from the physical size (ie. [`drm_gem_object.size`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object")).
Otherwise just use [`drm_gem_create_mmap_offset()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_create_mmap_offset "drm_gem_create_mmap_offset").

This function is idempotent and handles an already allocated mmap offset
transparently. Drivers do not need to check for this case.

int drm_gem_create_mmap_offset(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj)
:   create a fake mmap offset for an object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   obj in question

**Description**

GEM memory mapping works by handing back to userspace a fake mmap offset
it can use in a subsequent mmap(2) call. The DRM core code then looks
up the object based on the offset and sets up the various memory mapping
structures.

This routine allocates and attaches a fake offset for **obj**.

Drivers can call [`drm_gem_free_mmap_offset()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_free_mmap_offset "drm_gem_free_mmap_offset") before freeing **obj** to release
the fake offset again.

struct page \*\*drm_gem_get_pages(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj)
:   helper to allocate backing pages for a GEM object from shmem

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   obj in question

**Description**

This reads the page-array of the shmem-backing storage of the given gem
object. An array of pages is returned. If a page is not allocated or
swapped-out, this will allocate/swap-in the required pages. Note that the
whole object is covered by the page-array and pinned in memory.

Use [`drm_gem_put_pages()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_put_pages "drm_gem_put_pages") to release the array and unpin all pages.

This uses the GFP-mask set on the shmem-mapping (see mapping_set_gfp_mask()).
If you require other GFP-masks, you have to do those allocations yourself.

Note that you are not allowed to change gfp-zones during runtime. That is,
shmem_read_mapping_page_gfp() must be called with the same gfp_zone(gfp) as
set during initialization. If you have special zone constraints, set them
after [`drm_gem_object_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_init "drm_gem_object_init") via mapping_set_gfp_mask(). shmem-core takes care
to keep pages in the required zone during swap-in.

This function is only valid on objects initialized with
[`drm_gem_object_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_init "drm_gem_object_init"), but not for those initialized with
[`drm_gem_private_object_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_private_object_init "drm_gem_private_object_init") only.

void drm_gem_put_pages(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj, struct page \*\*pages, bool dirty, bool accessed)
:   helper to free backing pages for a GEM object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   obj in question

`struct page **pages`
:   pages to free

`bool dirty`
:   if true, pages will be marked as dirty

`bool accessed`
:   if true, the pages will be marked as accessed

int drm_gem_objects_lookup(struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*filp, void __user \*bo_handles, int count, struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*\*\*objs_out)
:   look up GEM objects from an array of handles

**Parameters**

`struct drm_file *filp`
:   DRM file private date

`void __user *bo_handles`
:   user pointer to array of userspace handle

`int count`
:   size of handle array

`struct drm_gem_object ***objs_out`
:   returned pointer to array of drm_gem_object pointers

**Description**

Takes an array of userspace handles and returns a newly allocated array of
GEM objects.

For a single handle lookup, use [`drm_gem_object_lookup()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_lookup "drm_gem_object_lookup").

**objs** filled in with GEM object pointers. Returned GEM objects need to be
released with [`drm_gem_object_put()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_put "drm_gem_object_put"). -ENOENT is returned on a lookup
failure. 0 is returned on success.

**Return**

struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*drm_gem_object_lookup(struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*filp, u32 handle)
:   look up a GEM object from its handle

**Parameters**

`struct drm_file *filp`
:   DRM file private date

`u32 handle`
:   userspace handle

**Return**

**Description**

A reference to the object named by the handle if such exists on **filp**, NULL
otherwise.

If looking up an array of handles, use [`drm_gem_objects_lookup()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_objects_lookup "drm_gem_objects_lookup").

long drm_gem_dma_resv_wait(struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*filep, u32 handle, bool wait_all, unsigned long timeout)
:   Wait on GEM object's reservation's objects shared and/or exclusive fences.

**Parameters**

`struct drm_file *filep`
:   DRM file private date

`u32 handle`
:   userspace handle

`bool wait_all`
:   if true, wait on all fences, else wait on just exclusive fence

`unsigned long timeout`
:   timeout value in jiffies or zero to return immediately

**Return**

**Description**

Returns -ERESTARTSYS if interrupted, 0 if the wait timed out, or
greater than 0 on success.

void drm_gem_object_release(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj)
:   release GEM buffer object resources

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   GEM buffer object

**Description**

This releases any structures and resources used by **obj** and is the inverse of
[`drm_gem_object_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_init "drm_gem_object_init").

void drm_gem_object_free(struct [kref](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_free "kref") \*kref)
:   free a GEM object

**Parameters**

`struct kref *kref`
:   kref of the object to free

**Description**

Called after the last reference to the object has been lost.

Frees the object

void drm_gem_vm_open(struct vm_area_struct \*vma)
:   vma->ops->open implementation for GEM

**Parameters**

`struct vm_area_struct *vma`
:   VM area structure

**Description**

This function implements the #vm_operations_struct open() callback for GEM
drivers. This must be used together with [`drm_gem_vm_close()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vm_close "drm_gem_vm_close").

void drm_gem_vm_close(struct vm_area_struct \*vma)
:   vma->ops->close implementation for GEM

**Parameters**

`struct vm_area_struct *vma`
:   VM area structure

**Description**

This function implements the #vm_operations_struct close() callback for GEM
drivers. This must be used together with [`drm_gem_vm_open()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vm_open "drm_gem_vm_open").

int drm_gem_mmap_obj(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj, unsigned long obj_size, struct vm_area_struct \*vma)
:   memory map a GEM object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   the GEM object to map

`unsigned long obj_size`
:   the object size to be mapped, in bytes

`struct vm_area_struct *vma`
:   VMA for the area to be mapped

**Description**

Set up the VMA to prepare mapping of the GEM object using the GEM object's
vm_ops. Depending on their requirements, GEM objects can either
provide a fault handler in their vm_ops (in which case any accesses to
the object will be trapped, to perform migration, GTT binding, surface
register allocation, or performance monitoring), or mmap the buffer memory
synchronously after calling drm_gem_mmap_obj.

This function is mainly intended to implement the DMABUF mmap operation, when
the GEM object is not looked up based on its fake offset. To implement the
DRM mmap operation, drivers should use the [`drm_gem_mmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_mmap "drm_gem_mmap") function.

[`drm_gem_mmap_obj()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_mmap_obj "drm_gem_mmap_obj") assumes the user is granted access to the buffer while
[`drm_gem_mmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_mmap "drm_gem_mmap") prevents unprivileged users from mapping random objects. So
callers must verify access restrictions before calling this helper.

Return 0 or success or -EINVAL if the object size is smaller than the VMA
size, or if no vm_ops are provided.

int drm_gem_mmap(struct file \*filp, struct vm_area_struct \*vma)
:   memory map routine for GEM objects

**Parameters**

`struct file *filp`
:   DRM file pointer

`struct vm_area_struct *vma`
:   VMA for the area to be mapped

**Description**

If a driver supports GEM object mapping, mmap calls on the DRM file
descriptor will end up here.

Look up the GEM object based on the offset passed in (vma->vm_pgoff will
contain the fake offset we created when the GTT map ioctl was called on
the object) and map it with a call to [`drm_gem_mmap_obj()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_mmap_obj "drm_gem_mmap_obj").

If the caller is not granted access to the buffer object, the mmap will fail
with EACCES. Please see the vma manager for more information.

int drm_gem_lock_reservations(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*\*objs, int count, struct ww_acquire_ctx \*acquire_ctx)
:   Sets up the ww context and acquires the lock on an array of GEM objects.

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_object **objs`
:   drm_gem_objects to lock

`int count`
:   Number of objects in **objs**

`struct ww_acquire_ctx *acquire_ctx`
:   struct ww_acquire_ctx that will be initialized as
    part of tracking this set of locked reservations.

**Description**

Once you've locked your reservations, you'll want to set up space
for your shared fences (if applicable), submit your job, then
drm_gem_unlock_reservations().

void drm_gem_lru_init(struct [drm_gem_lru](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_lru "drm_gem_lru") \*lru, struct mutex \*lock)
:   initialize a LRU

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_lru *lru`
:   The LRU to initialize

`struct mutex *lock`
:   The lock protecting the LRU

void drm_gem_lru_remove(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj)
:   remove object from whatever LRU it is in

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   The GEM object to remove from current LRU

**Description**

If the object is currently in any LRU, remove it.

void drm_gem_lru_move_tail_locked(struct [drm_gem_lru](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_lru "drm_gem_lru") \*lru, struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj)
:   move the object to the tail of the LRU

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_lru *lru`
:   The LRU to move the object into.

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   The GEM object to move into this LRU

**Description**

Like [`drm_gem_lru_move_tail`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_lru_move_tail "drm_gem_lru_move_tail") but lru lock must be held

void drm_gem_lru_move_tail(struct [drm_gem_lru](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_lru "drm_gem_lru") \*lru, struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj)
:   move the object to the tail of the LRU

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_lru *lru`
:   The LRU to move the object into.

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   The GEM object to move into this LRU

**Description**

If the object is already in this LRU it will be moved to the
tail. Otherwise it will be removed from whichever other LRU
it is in (if any) and moved into this LRU.

unsigned long drm_gem_lru_scan(struct [drm_gem_lru](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_lru "drm_gem_lru") \*lru, unsigned int nr_to_scan, unsigned long \*remaining, bool (\*shrink)(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj))
:   helper to implement shrinker.scan_objects

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_lru *lru`
:   The LRU to scan

`unsigned int nr_to_scan`
:   The number of pages to try to reclaim

`unsigned long *remaining`
:   The number of pages left to reclaim, should be initialized by caller

`bool (*shrink)(struct drm_gem_object *obj)`
:   Callback to try to shrink/reclaim the object.

**Description**

If the shrink callback succeeds, it is expected that the driver
move the object out of this LRU.

If the LRU possibly contain active buffers, it is the responsibility
of the shrink callback to check for this (ie. [`dma_resv_test_signaled()`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_resv_test_signaled "dma_resv_test_signaled"))
or if necessary block until the buffer becomes idle.

:   helper to evict backing pages for a GEM object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   obj in question

### GEM DMA Helper Functions Reference

The DRM GEM/DMA helpers are a means to provide buffer objects that are
presented to the device as a contiguous chunk of memory. This is useful
for devices that do not support scatter-gather DMA (either directly or
by using an intimately attached IOMMU).

For devices that access the memory bus through an (external) IOMMU then
the buffer objects are allocated using a traditional page-based
allocator and may be scattered through physical memory. However they
are contiguous in the IOVA space so appear contiguous to devices using
them.

For other devices then the helpers rely on CMA to provide buffer
objects that are physically contiguous in memory.

For GEM callback helpers in struct [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") functions, see likewise
named functions with an _object_ infix (e.g., drm_gem_dma_object_vmap() wraps
[`drm_gem_dma_vmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dma_vmap "drm_gem_dma_vmap")). These helpers perform the necessary type conversion.

DEFINE_DRM_GEM_DMA_FOPS

`DEFINE_DRM_GEM_DMA_FOPS (name)`

> macro to generate file operations for DMA drivers

**Parameters**

`name`
:   name for the generated structure

**Description**

This macro autogenerates a suitable `struct file_operations` for DMA based
drivers, which can be assigned to [`drm_driver.fops`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver"). Note that this structure
cannot be shared between drivers, because it contains a reference to the
current module using THIS_MODULE.

Note that the declaration is already marked as static - if you need a
non-static version of this you're probably doing it wrong and will break the
THIS_MODULE reference by accident.

struct [drm_gem_dma_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dma_object "drm_gem_dma_object") \*drm_gem_dma_create(struct [drm_device](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") \*drm, size_t size)
:   allocate an object with the given size

**Parameters**

`struct drm_device *drm`
:   DRM device

`size_t size`
:   size of the object to allocate

**Description**

This function creates a DMA GEM object and allocates memory as backing store.
The allocated memory will occupy a contiguous chunk of bus address space.

For devices that are directly connected to the memory bus then the allocated
memory will be physically contiguous. For devices that access through an
IOMMU, then the allocated memory is not expected to be physically contiguous
because having contiguous IOVAs is sufficient to meet a devices DMA
requirements.

**Return**

A [`struct drm_gem_dma_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dma_object "drm_gem_dma_object") \* on success or an [`ERR_PTR()`](../core-api/kernel-api.md#c.ERR_PTR "ERR_PTR")-encoded negative
error code on failure.

void drm_gem_dma_free(struct [drm_gem_dma_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dma_object "drm_gem_dma_object") \*dma_obj)
:   free resources associated with a DMA GEM object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_dma_object *dma_obj`
:   DMA GEM object to free

**Description**

This function frees the backing memory of the DMA GEM object, cleans up the
GEM object state and frees the memory used to store the object itself.
If the buffer is imported and the virtual address is set, it is released.

int drm_gem_dma_dumb_create_internal(struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*file_priv, struct [drm_device](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") \*drm, struct [drm_mode_create_dumb](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_mode_create_dumb "drm_mode_create_dumb") \*args)

:   DRM file-private structure to create the dumb buffer for

`struct drm_device *drm`
:   DRM device

`struct drm_mode_create_dumb *args`
:   IOCTL data

**Description**

This aligns the pitch and size arguments to the minimum required. This is
an internal helper that can be wrapped by a driver to account for hardware
with more specific alignment requirements. It should not be used directly
as their [`drm_driver.dumb_create`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") callback.

**Return**

0 on success or a negative error code on failure.

int drm_gem_dma_dumb_create(struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*file_priv, struct [drm_device](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") \*drm, struct [drm_mode_create_dumb](drm-uapi.md#c.drm_mode_create_dumb "drm_mode_create_dumb") \*args)
:   create a dumb buffer object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_file *file_priv`
:   DRM file-private structure to create the dumb buffer for

`struct drm_device *drm`
:   DRM device

`struct drm_mode_create_dumb *args`
:   IOCTL data

**Description**

This function computes the pitch of the dumb buffer and rounds it up to an
integer number of bytes per pixel. Drivers for hardware that doesn't have
any additional restrictions on the pitch can directly use this function as
their [`drm_driver.dumb_create`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") callback.

For hardware with additional restrictions, drivers can adjust the fields
set up by userspace and pass the IOCTL data along to the
[`drm_gem_dma_dumb_create_internal()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dma_dumb_create_internal "drm_gem_dma_dumb_create_internal") function.

**Return**

0 on success or a negative error code on failure.

for a given buffer.
It's intended to be used as a direct handler for the struct
`file_operations.get_unmapped_area` operation.

**Return**

mapping address on success or a negative error code on failure.

:   provide a scatter/gather table of pinned pages for a DMA GEM object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_dma_object *dma_obj`
:   DMA GEM object

**Description**

**Parameters**

`struct drm_device *dev`
:   device to import into

`struct dma_buf_attachment *attach`
:   DMA-BUF attachment

`struct sg_table *sgt`
:   scatter/gather table of pinned pages

**Description**

This function imports a scatter/gather table exported via DMA-BUF by
another driver. Imported buffers must be physically contiguous in memory
(i.e. the scatter/gather table must contain a single entry). Drivers that
use the DMA helpers should set this as their
[`drm_driver.gem_prime_import_sg_table`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") callback.

**Return**

A pointer to a newly created GEM object or an ERR_PTR-encoded negative
error code on failure.

int drm_gem_dma_vmap(struct [drm_gem_dma_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dma_object "drm_gem_dma_object") \*dma_obj, struct [iosys_map](../driver-api/device-io.md#c.iosys_map "iosys_map") \*map)
:   map a DMA GEM object into the kernel's virtual address space

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_dma_object *dma_obj`
:   DMA GEM object

`struct iosys_map *map`
:   Returns the kernel virtual address of the DMA GEM object's backing
    store.

**Description**

This function maps a buffer into the kernel's virtual address space.
Since the DMA buffers are already mapped into the kernel virtual address
space this simply returns the cached virtual address.

**Return**

0 on success, or a negative error code otherwise.

int drm_gem_dma_mmap(struct [drm_gem_dma_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dma_object "drm_gem_dma_object") \*dma_obj, struct vm_area_struct \*vma)
:   memory-map an exported DMA GEM object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_dma_object *dma_obj`
:   DMA GEM object

`struct vm_area_struct *vma`
:   VMA for the area to be mapped

**Description**

This function maps a buffer into a userspace process's address space.
In addition to the usual GEM VMA setup it immediately faults in the entire
object instead of using on-demand faulting.

**Return**

0 on success or a negative error code on failure.

struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*drm_gem_dma_prime_import_sg_table_vmap(struct [drm_device](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") \*dev, struct [dma_buf_attachment](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_buf_attachment "dma_buf_attachment") \*attach, struct sg_table \*sgt)
:   PRIME import another driver's scatter/gather table and get the virtual address of the buffer

**Parameters**

`struct drm_device *dev`
:   DRM device

`struct dma_buf_attachment *attach`
:   DMA-BUF attachment

`struct sg_table *sgt`
:   Scatter/gather table of pinned pages

**Description**

This function imports a scatter/gather table using
[`drm_gem_dma_prime_import_sg_table()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dma_prime_import_sg_table "drm_gem_dma_prime_import_sg_table") and uses [`dma_buf_vmap()`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_buf_vmap "dma_buf_vmap") to get the kernel
virtual address. This ensures that a DMA GEM object always has its virtual
address set. This address is released when the object is freed.

This function can be used as the [`drm_driver.gem_prime_import_sg_table`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver")
callback. The [`DRM_GEM_DMA_DRIVER_OPS_VMAP`](drm-mm.md#c.DRM_GEM_DMA_DRIVER_OPS_VMAP "DRM_GEM_DMA_DRIVER_OPS_VMAP") macro provides a shortcut to set
the necessary DRM driver operations.

**Return**

A pointer to a newly created GEM object or an ERR_PTR-encoded negative
error code on failure.

### GEM SHMEM Helper Function Reference

This function imports a scatter/gather table exported via DMA-BUF by
another driver. Drivers that use the shmem helpers should set this as their
[`drm_driver.gem_prime_import_sg_table`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") callback.

**Return**

A pointer to a newly created GEM object or an ERR_PTR-encoded negative
error code on failure.

### GEM VRAM Helper Functions Reference

This library provides [`struct drm_gem_vram_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_object "drm_gem_vram_object") (GEM VRAM), a GEM
buffer object that is backed by video RAM (VRAM). It can be used for
framebuffer devices with dedicated memory.

The data structure [`struct drm_vram_mm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vram_mm "drm_vram_mm") and its helpers implement a memory
manager for simple framebuffer devices with dedicated video memory. GEM
VRAM buffer objects are either placed in the video memory or remain evicted
to system memory.

With the GEM interface userspace applications create, manage and destroy
graphics buffers, such as an on-screen framebuffer. GEM does not provide
an implementation of these interfaces. It's up to the DRM driver to
provide an implementation that suits the hardware. If the hardware device
contains dedicated video memory, the DRM driver can use the VRAM helper
library. Each active buffer object is stored in video RAM. Active
buffer are used for drawing the current frame, typically something like
the frame's scanout buffer or the cursor image. If there's no more space
left in VRAM, inactive GEM objects can be moved to system memory.

To initialize the VRAM helper library call [`drmm_vram_helper_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drmm_vram_helper_init "drmm_vram_helper_init").
The function allocates and initializes an instance of [`struct drm_vram_mm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vram_mm "drm_vram_mm")
in [`struct drm_device`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device").vram_mm . Use [`DRM_GEM_VRAM_DRIVER`](drm-mm.md#c.DRM_GEM_VRAM_DRIVER "DRM_GEM_VRAM_DRIVER") to initialize
[`struct drm_driver`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") and `DRM_VRAM_MM_FILE_OPERATIONS` to initialize
`struct file_operations`; as illustrated below.

```c
struct file_operations fops ={
        .owner = THIS_MODULE,
        DRM_VRAM_MM_FILE_OPERATION
};
struct drm_driver drv = {
        .driver_feature = DRM_ ... ,
        .fops = &fops,
        DRM_GEM_VRAM_DRIVER
};

int init_drm_driver()
{
        struct drm_device *dev;
        uint64_t vram_base;
        unsigned long vram_size;
        int ret;

        // setup device, vram base and size
        // ...

        ret = drmm_vram_helper_init(dev, vram_base, vram_size);
        if (ret)
                return ret;
        return 0;
}
```

This creates an instance of [`struct drm_vram_mm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vram_mm "drm_vram_mm"), exports DRM userspace
interfaces for GEM buffer management and initializes file operations to
allow for accessing created GEM buffers. With this setup, the DRM driver
manages an area of video RAM with VRAM MM and provides GEM VRAM objects
to userspace.

You don't have to clean up the instance of VRAM MM.
[`drmm_vram_helper_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drmm_vram_helper_init "drmm_vram_helper_init") is a managed interface that installs a
clean-up handler to run during the DRM device's release.

For drawing or scanout operations, rsp. buffer objects have to be pinned
in video RAM. Call [`drm_gem_vram_pin()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_pin "drm_gem_vram_pin") with `DRM_GEM_VRAM_PL_FLAG_VRAM` or
`DRM_GEM_VRAM_PL_FLAG_SYSTEM` to pin a buffer object in video RAM or system
memory. Call [`drm_gem_vram_unpin()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_unpin "drm_gem_vram_unpin") to release the pinned object afterwards.

A buffer object that is pinned in video RAM has a fixed address within that
memory region. Call [`drm_gem_vram_offset()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_offset "drm_gem_vram_offset") to retrieve this value. Typically
it's used to program the hardware's scanout engine for framebuffers, set
the cursor overlay's image for a mouse cursor, or use it as input to the
hardware's drawing engine.

To access a buffer object's memory from the DRM driver, call
[`drm_gem_vram_vmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_vmap "drm_gem_vram_vmap"). It maps the buffer into kernel address
space and returns the memory address. Use [`drm_gem_vram_vunmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_vunmap "drm_gem_vram_vunmap") to
release the mapping.

struct drm_gem_vram_object
:   GEM object backed by VRAM

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_gem_vram_object {
    struct ttm_buffer_object bo;
    struct iosys_map map;
    unsigned int vmap_use_count;
    struct ttm_placement placement;
    struct ttm_place placements[2];
};
```

**Members**

`bo`
:   TTM buffer object

`map`
:   Mapping information for **bo**

`vmap_use_count`
:   Reference count on the virtual address.
    The address are un-mapped when the count reaches zero.

`placement`
:   TTM placement information. Supported placements are `TTM_PL_VRAM` and `TTM_PL_SYSTEM`

`placements`
:   TTM placement information.

**Description**

The type [`struct drm_gem_vram_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_object "drm_gem_vram_object") represents a GEM object that is
backed by VRAM. It can be used for simple framebuffer devices with
dedicated memory. The buffer object can be evicted to system memory if
video memory becomes scarce.

GEM VRAM objects perform reference counting for pin and mapping
operations. So a buffer object that has been pinned N times with
[`drm_gem_vram_pin()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_pin "drm_gem_vram_pin") must be unpinned N times with
[`drm_gem_vram_unpin()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_unpin "drm_gem_vram_unpin"). The same applies to pairs of
drm_gem_vram_kmap() and drm_gem_vram_kunmap(), as well as pairs of
[`drm_gem_vram_vmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_vmap "drm_gem_vram_vmap") and [`drm_gem_vram_vunmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_vunmap "drm_gem_vram_vunmap").

`struct drm_device *dev`
:   the DRM device

`size_t size`
:   the buffer size in bytes

`unsigned long pg_align`
:   the buffer's alignment in multiples of the page size

**Description**

GEM objects are allocated by calling [`struct drm_driver`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver").gem_create_object,
if set. Otherwise [`kzalloc()`](../core-api/mm-api.md#c.kzalloc "kzalloc") will be used. Drivers can set their own GEM
object functions in [`struct drm_driver`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver").gem_create_object. If no functions
are set, the new GEM object will use the default functions from GEM VRAM
helpers.

**Return**

A new instance of [`struct drm_gem_vram_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_object "drm_gem_vram_object") on success, or
an [`ERR_PTR()`](../core-api/kernel-api.md#c.ERR_PTR "ERR_PTR")-encoded error code otherwise.

void drm_gem_vram_put(struct [drm_gem_vram_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_object "drm_gem_vram_object") \*gbo)
:   Releases a reference to a VRAM-backed GEM object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_vram_object *gbo`
:   the GEM VRAM object

**Description**

See ttm_bo_put() for more information.

s64 drm_gem_vram_offset(struct [drm_gem_vram_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_object "drm_gem_vram_object") \*gbo)
:   Returns a GEM VRAM object's offset in video memory

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_vram_object *gbo`
:   the GEM VRAM object

**Description**

This function returns the buffer object's offset in the device's video
memory. The buffer object has to be pinned to `TTM_PL_VRAM`.

**Return**

The buffer object's offset in video memory on success, or
a negative errno code otherwise.

int drm_gem_vram_pin(struct [drm_gem_vram_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_object "drm_gem_vram_object") \*gbo, unsigned long pl_flag)
:   Pins a GEM VRAM object in a region.

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_vram_object *gbo`
:   the GEM VRAM object

`unsigned long pl_flag`
:   a bitmask of possible memory regions

**Description**

Pinning a buffer object ensures that it is not evicted from
a memory region. A pinned buffer object has to be unpinned before
it can be pinned to another region. If the pl_flag argument is 0,
the buffer is pinned at its current location (video RAM or system
memory).

Small buffer objects, such as cursor images, can lead to memory
fragmentation if they are pinned in the middle of video RAM. This
is especially a problem on devices with only a small amount of
video RAM. Fragmentation can prevent the primary framebuffer from
fitting in, even though there's enough memory overall. The modifier
DRM_GEM_VRAM_PL_FLAG_TOPDOWN marks the buffer object to be pinned
at the high end of the memory region to avoid fragmentation.

**Return**

0 on success, or
a negative error code otherwise.

:   Pins and maps a GEM VRAM object into kernel address space

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_vram_object *gbo`
:   The GEM VRAM object to map

`struct iosys_map *map`
:   Returns the kernel virtual address of the VRAM GEM object's backing
    store.

**Description**

The vmap function pins a GEM VRAM object to its current location, either
system or video memory, and maps its buffer into kernel address space.
As pinned object cannot be relocated, you should avoid pinning objects
permanently. Call [`drm_gem_vram_vunmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_vram_vunmap "drm_gem_vram_vunmap") with the returned address to
unmap and unpin the GEM VRAM object.

**Return**

void drm_vram_mm_debugfs_init(struct [drm_minor](drm-internals.md#c.drm_minor "drm_minor") \*minor)
:   Register VRAM MM debugfs file.

**Parameters**

`struct drm_minor *minor`

int drmm_vram_helper_init(struct [drm_device](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") \*dev, uint64_t vram_base, size_t vram_size)
:   Initializes a device's instance of [`struct drm_vram_mm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vram_mm "drm_vram_mm")

**Parameters**

`struct drm_device *dev`
:   the DRM device

`uint64_t vram_base`
:   the base address of the video memory

`size_t vram_size`
:   the size of the video memory in bytes

**Description**

Creates a new instance of [`struct drm_vram_mm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vram_mm "drm_vram_mm") and stores it in
struct [`drm_device.vram_mm`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device"). The instance is auto-managed and cleaned
up as part of device cleanup. Calling this function multiple times
will generate an error message.

enum [drm_mode_status](drm-kms.md#c.drm_mode_status "drm_mode_status") drm_vram_helper_mode_valid(struct [drm_device](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") \*dev, const struct [drm_display_mode](drm-kms.md#c.drm_display_mode "drm_display_mode") \*mode)
:   Tests if a display mode's framebuffer fits into the available video memory.

**Parameters**

`struct drm_device *dev`
:   the DRM device

`const struct drm_display_mode *mode`
:   the mode to test

**Description**

This function tests if enough video memory is available for using the
specified display mode. Atomic modesetting requires importing the
designated framebuffer into video memory before evicting the active
one. Hence, any framebuffer may consume at most half of the available
VRAM. Display modes that require a larger framebuffer can not be used,
even if the CRTC does support them. Each framebuffer is assumed to
have 32-bit color depth.

**Note**

The function can only test if the display mode is supported in
general. If there are too many framebuffers pinned to video memory,
a display mode may still not be usable in practice. The color depth of
32-bit fits all current use case. A more flexible test can be added
when necessary.

**Return**

MODE_OK if the display mode is supported, or an error code of type
[`enum drm_mode_status`](drm-kms.md#c.drm_mode_status "drm_mode_status") otherwise.

See struct [`drm_driver.dumb_map_offset`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver").

**Return**

0 on success, or a negative errno code otherwise.

## VMA Offset Manager

The vma-manager is responsible to map arbitrary driver-dependent memory
regions into the linear user address-space. It provides offsets to the
caller which can then be used on the address_space of the drm-device. It
takes care to not overlap regions, size them appropriately and to not
confuse mm-core by inconsistent fake vm_pgoff fields.
Drivers shouldn't use this for object placement in VMEM. This manager should
only be used to manage mappings into linear user-space VMs.

We use drm_mm as backend to manage object allocations. But it is highly
optimized for alloc/free calls, not lookups. Hence, we use an rb-tree to
speed up offset lookups.

You must not use multiple offset managers on a single address_space.
Otherwise, mm-core will be unable to tear down memory mappings as the VM will
no longer be linear.

This offset manager works on page-based addresses. That is, every argument
and return code (with the exception of [`drm_vma_node_offset_addr()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_node_offset_addr "drm_vma_node_offset_addr")) is given
in number of pages, not number of bytes. That means, object sizes and offsets
must always be page-aligned (as usual).
If you want to get a valid byte-based user-space address for a given offset,
please see [`drm_vma_node_offset_addr()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_node_offset_addr "drm_vma_node_offset_addr").

Additionally to offset management, the vma offset manager also handles access
management. For every open-file context that is allowed to access a given
node, you must call [`drm_vma_node_allow()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_node_allow "drm_vma_node_allow"). Otherwise, an mmap() call on this
open-file with the offset of the node will fail with -EACCES. To revoke
access again, use [`drm_vma_node_revoke()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_node_revoke "drm_vma_node_revoke"). However, the caller is responsible
for destroying already existing mappings, if required.

struct drm_vma_offset_node \*drm_vma_offset_exact_lookup_locked(struct drm_vma_offset_manager \*mgr, unsigned long start, unsigned long pages)
:   Look up node by exact address

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_manager *mgr`
:   Manager object

`unsigned long start`
:   Start address (page-based, not byte-based)

`unsigned long pages`
:   Size of object (page-based)

**Description**

Same as [`drm_vma_offset_lookup_locked()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_offset_lookup_locked "drm_vma_offset_lookup_locked") but does not allow any offset into the node.
It only returns the exact object with the given start address.

**Return**

Node at exact start address **start**.

void drm_vma_offset_lock_lookup(struct drm_vma_offset_manager \*mgr)
:   Lock lookup for extended private use

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_manager *mgr`
:   Manager object

**Description**

Lock VMA manager for extended lookups. Only locked VMA function calls
are allowed while holding this lock. All other contexts are blocked from VMA
until the lock is released via [`drm_vma_offset_unlock_lookup()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_offset_unlock_lookup "drm_vma_offset_unlock_lookup").

Use this if you need to take a reference to the objects returned by
[`drm_vma_offset_lookup_locked()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_offset_lookup_locked "drm_vma_offset_lookup_locked") before releasing this lock again.

This lock must not be used for anything else than extended lookups. You must
not call any other VMA helpers while holding this lock.

**Note**

You're in atomic-context while holding this lock!

void drm_vma_offset_unlock_lookup(struct drm_vma_offset_manager \*mgr)
:   Unlock lookup for extended private use

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_manager *mgr`
:   Manager object

**Description**

Release lookup-lock. See [`drm_vma_offset_lock_lookup()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_offset_lock_lookup "drm_vma_offset_lock_lookup") for more information.

void drm_vma_node_reset(struct drm_vma_offset_node \*node)
:   Initialize or reset node object

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_node *node`
:   Node to initialize or reset

**Description**

Reset a node to its initial state. This must be called before using it with
any VMA offset manager.

This must not be called on an already allocated node, or you will leak
memory.

unsigned long drm_vma_node_start(const struct drm_vma_offset_node \*node)
:   Return start address for page-based addressing

**Parameters**

`const struct drm_vma_offset_node *node`
:   Node to inspect

**Description**

Return the start address of the given node. This can be used as offset into
the linear VM space that is provided by the VMA offset manager. Note that
this can only be used for page-based addressing. If you need a proper offset
for user-space mappings, you must apply "<< PAGE_SHIFT" or use the
[`drm_vma_node_offset_addr()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_node_offset_addr "drm_vma_node_offset_addr") helper instead.

**Return**

Start address of **node** for page-based addressing. 0 if the node does not
have an offset allocated.

unsigned long drm_vma_node_size(struct drm_vma_offset_node \*node)
:   Return size (page-based)

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_node *node`
:   Node to inspect

**Description**

Return the size as number of pages for the given node. This is the same size
that was passed to [`drm_vma_offset_add()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_offset_add "drm_vma_offset_add"). If no offset is allocated for the
node, this is 0.

**Return**

Size of **node** as number of pages. 0 if the node does not have an offset
allocated.

__u64 drm_vma_node_offset_addr(struct drm_vma_offset_node \*node)
:   Return sanitized offset for user-space mmaps

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_node *node`
:   Linked offset node

**Description**

Same as [`drm_vma_node_start()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_node_start "drm_vma_node_start") but returns the address as a valid offset that
can be used for user-space mappings during mmap().
This must not be called on unlinked nodes.

**Return**

Offset of **node** for byte-based addressing. 0 if the node does not have an
object allocated.

void drm_vma_node_unmap(struct drm_vma_offset_node \*node, struct [address_space](../filesystems/api-summary.md#c.address_space "address_space") \*file_mapping)
:   Unmap offset node

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_node *node`
:   Offset node

`struct address_space *file_mapping`
:   Address space to unmap **node** from

**Description**

Unmap all userspace mappings for a given offset node. The mappings must be
associated with the **file_mapping** address-space. If no offset exists
nothing is done.

This call is unlocked. The caller must guarantee that [`drm_vma_offset_remove()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_offset_remove "drm_vma_offset_remove")
is not called on this node concurrently.

int drm_vma_node_verify_access(struct drm_vma_offset_node \*node, struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*tag)
:   Access verification helper for TTM

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_node *node`
:   Offset node

`struct drm_file *tag`
:   Tag of file to check

**Description**

This checks whether **tag** is granted access to **node**. It is the same as
[`drm_vma_node_is_allowed()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_node_is_allowed "drm_vma_node_is_allowed") but suitable as drop-in helper for TTM
verify_access() callbacks.

**Return**

0 if access is granted, -EACCES otherwise.

void drm_vma_offset_manager_init(struct drm_vma_offset_manager \*mgr, unsigned long page_offset, unsigned long size)
:   Initialize new offset-manager

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_manager *mgr`
:   Manager object

`unsigned long page_offset`
:   Offset of available memory area (page-based)

`unsigned long size`
:   Size of available address space range (page-based)

**Description**

Initialize a new offset-manager. The offset and area size available for the
manager are given as **page_offset** and **size**. Both are interpreted as
page-numbers, not bytes.

Adding/removing nodes from the manager is locked internally and protected
against concurrent access. However, node allocation and destruction is left
for the caller. While calling into the vma-manager, a given node must
always be guaranteed to be referenced.

void drm_vma_offset_manager_destroy(struct drm_vma_offset_manager \*mgr)
:   Destroy offset manager

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_manager *mgr`
:   Manager object

**Description**

Destroy an object manager which was previously created via
[`drm_vma_offset_manager_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_offset_manager_init "drm_vma_offset_manager_init"). The caller must remove all allocated nodes
before destroying the manager. Otherwise, drm_mm will refuse to free the
requested resources.

The manager must not be accessed after this function is called.

struct drm_vma_offset_node \*drm_vma_offset_lookup_locked(struct drm_vma_offset_manager \*mgr, unsigned long start, unsigned long pages)
:   Find node in offset space

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_manager *mgr`
:   Manager object

`unsigned long start`
:   Start address for object (page-based)

`unsigned long pages`
:   Size of object (page-based)

**Description**

Find a node given a start address and object size. This returns the _best_
match for the given node. That is, **start** may point somewhere into a valid
region and the given node will be returned, as long as the node spans the
whole requested area (given the size in number of pages as **pages**).

Note that before lookup the vma offset manager lookup lock must be acquired
with [`drm_vma_offset_lock_lookup()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_offset_lock_lookup "drm_vma_offset_lock_lookup"). See there for an example. This can then be
used to implement weakly referenced lookups using kref_get_unless_zero().

```
drm_vma_offset_lock_lookup(mgr);
node = drm_vma_offset_lookup_locked(mgr);
if (node)
    kref_get_unless_zero(container_of(node, sth, entr));
drm_vma_offset_unlock_lookup(mgr);
```

**Example**

**Return**

Returns NULL if no suitable node can be found. Otherwise, the best match
is returned. It's the caller's responsibility to make sure the node doesn't
get destroyed before the caller can access it.

int drm_vma_offset_add(struct drm_vma_offset_manager \*mgr, struct drm_vma_offset_node \*node, unsigned long pages)
:   Add offset node to manager

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_manager *mgr`
:   Manager object

`struct drm_vma_offset_node *node`
:   Node to be added

`unsigned long pages`
:   Allocation size visible to user-space (in number of pages)

**Description**

Add a node to the offset-manager. If the node was already added, this does
nothing and return 0. **pages** is the size of the object given in number of
pages.
After this call succeeds, you can access the offset of the node until it
is removed again.

If this call fails, it is safe to retry the operation or call
[`drm_vma_offset_remove()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_offset_remove "drm_vma_offset_remove"), anyway. However, no cleanup is required in that
case.

**pages** is not required to be the same size as the underlying memory object
that you want to map. It only limits the size that user-space can map into
their address space.

**Return**

0 on success, negative error code on failure.

void drm_vma_offset_remove(struct drm_vma_offset_manager \*mgr, struct drm_vma_offset_node \*node)
:   Remove offset node from manager

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_manager *mgr`
:   Manager object

`struct drm_vma_offset_node *node`
:   Node to be removed

**Description**

Remove a node from the offset manager. If the node wasn't added before, this
does nothing. After this call returns, the offset and size will be 0 until a
new offset is allocated via [`drm_vma_offset_add()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_offset_add "drm_vma_offset_add") again. Helper functions like
[`drm_vma_node_start()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_node_start "drm_vma_node_start") and [`drm_vma_node_offset_addr()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_node_offset_addr "drm_vma_node_offset_addr") will return 0 if no
offset is allocated.

int drm_vma_node_allow(struct drm_vma_offset_node \*node, struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*tag)
:   Add open-file to list of allowed users

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_node *node`
:   Node to modify

`struct drm_file *tag`
:   Tag of file to remove

**Description**

Add **tag** to the list of allowed open-files for this node. If **tag** is
already on this list, the ref-count is incremented.

The list of allowed-users is preserved across [`drm_vma_offset_add()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_offset_add "drm_vma_offset_add") and
[`drm_vma_offset_remove()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_offset_remove "drm_vma_offset_remove") calls. You may even call it if the node is currently
not added to any offset-manager.

You must remove all open-files the same number of times as you added them
before destroying the node. Otherwise, you will leak memory.

This is locked against concurrent access internally.

**Return**

0 on success, negative error code on internal failure (out-of-mem)

int drm_vma_node_allow_once(struct drm_vma_offset_node \*node, struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*tag)
:   Add open-file to list of allowed users

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_node *node`
:   Node to modify

`struct drm_file *tag`
:   Tag of file to remove

**Description**

Add **tag** to the list of allowed open-files for this node.

The list of allowed-users is preserved across [`drm_vma_offset_add()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_offset_add "drm_vma_offset_add") and
[`drm_vma_offset_remove()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_offset_remove "drm_vma_offset_remove") calls. You may even call it if the node is currently
not added to any offset-manager.

This is not ref-counted unlike [`drm_vma_node_allow()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_node_allow "drm_vma_node_allow") hence [`drm_vma_node_revoke()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_node_revoke "drm_vma_node_revoke")
should only be called once after this.

This is locked against concurrent access internally.

**Return**

0 on success, negative error code on internal failure (out-of-mem)

void drm_vma_node_revoke(struct drm_vma_offset_node \*node, struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*tag)
:   Remove open-file from list of allowed users

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_node *node`
:   Node to modify

`struct drm_file *tag`
:   Tag of file to remove

**Description**

Decrement the ref-count of **tag** in the list of allowed open-files on **node**.
If the ref-count drops to zero, remove **tag** from the list. You must call
this once for every [`drm_vma_node_allow()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_node_allow "drm_vma_node_allow") on **tag**.

This is locked against concurrent access internally.

If **tag** is not on the list, nothing is done.

bool drm_vma_node_is_allowed(struct drm_vma_offset_node \*node, struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*tag)
:   Check whether an open-file is granted access

**Parameters**

`struct drm_vma_offset_node *node`
:   Node to check

`struct drm_file *tag`
:   Tag of file to remove

**Description**

Search the list in **node** whether **tag** is currently on the list of allowed
open-files (see [`drm_vma_node_allow()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_vma_node_allow "drm_vma_node_allow")).

This is locked against concurrent access internally.

**Return**

true if **filp** is on the list

## PRIME Buffer Sharing

PRIME is the cross device buffer sharing framework in drm, originally
created for the OPTIMUS range of multi-gpu platforms. To userspace PRIME
buffers are dma-buf based file descriptors.

### Overview and Lifetime Rules

Similar to GEM global names, PRIME file descriptors are also used to share
buffer objects across processes. They offer additional security: as file
descriptors must be explicitly sent over UNIX domain sockets to be shared
between applications, they can't be guessed like the globally unique GEM
names.

Drivers that support the PRIME API implement the drm_gem_object_funcs.export
and [`drm_driver.gem_prime_import`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") hooks. [`dma_buf_ops`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_buf_ops "dma_buf_ops") implementations for
drivers are all individually exported for drivers which need to overwrite
or reimplement some of them.

#### Reference Counting for GEM Drivers

On the export the [`dma_buf`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_buf "dma_buf") holds a reference to the exported buffer object,
usually a [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object"). It takes this reference in the PRIME_HANDLE_TO_FD
IOCTL, when it first calls [`drm_gem_object_funcs.export`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_funcs "drm_gem_object_funcs")
and stores the exporting GEM object in the [`dma_buf.priv`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_buf "dma_buf") field. This
reference needs to be released when the final reference to the [`dma_buf`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_buf "dma_buf")
itself is dropped and its [`dma_buf_ops.release`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_buf_ops "dma_buf_ops") function is called. For
GEM-based drivers, the [`dma_buf`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_buf "dma_buf") should be exported using
[`drm_gem_dmabuf_export()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dmabuf_export "drm_gem_dmabuf_export") and then released by [`drm_gem_dmabuf_release()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dmabuf_release "drm_gem_dmabuf_release").

Thus the chain of references always flows in one direction, avoiding loops:
importing GEM object -> dma-buf -> exported GEM bo. A further complication
are the lookup caches for import and export. These are required to guarantee
that any given object will always have only one unique userspace handle. This
is required to allow userspace to detect duplicated imports, since some GEM
drivers do fail command submissions if a given buffer object is listed more
than once. These import and export caches in [`drm_prime_file_private`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_prime_file_private "drm_prime_file_private") only
retain a weak reference, which is cleaned up when the corresponding object is
released.

Self-importing: If userspace is using PRIME as a replacement for flink then
it will get a fd->handle request for a GEM object that it created. Drivers
should detect this situation and return back the underlying object from the
dma-buf private. For GEM based drivers this is handled in
[`drm_gem_prime_import()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_prime_import "drm_gem_prime_import") already.

### PRIME Helper Functions

Drivers can implement [`drm_gem_object_funcs.export`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_funcs "drm_gem_object_funcs") and
[`drm_driver.gem_prime_import`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") in terms of simpler APIs by using the helper
functions [`drm_gem_prime_export()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_prime_export "drm_gem_prime_export") and [`drm_gem_prime_import()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_prime_import "drm_gem_prime_import"). These functions
implement dma-buf support in terms of some lower-level helpers, which are
again exported for drivers to use individually:

#### Exporting buffers

Optional pinning of buffers is handled at dma-buf attach and detach time in
[`drm_gem_map_attach()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_map_attach "drm_gem_map_attach") and [`drm_gem_map_detach()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_map_detach "drm_gem_map_detach"). Backing storage itself is
handled by [`drm_gem_map_dma_buf()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_map_dma_buf "drm_gem_map_dma_buf") and [`drm_gem_unmap_dma_buf()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_unmap_dma_buf "drm_gem_unmap_dma_buf"), which relies on
[`drm_gem_object_funcs.get_sg_table`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_funcs "drm_gem_object_funcs"). If [`drm_gem_object_funcs.get_sg_table`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_funcs "drm_gem_object_funcs") is
unimplemented, exports into another device are rejected.

For kernel-internal access there's [`drm_gem_dmabuf_vmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dmabuf_vmap "drm_gem_dmabuf_vmap") and
[`drm_gem_dmabuf_vunmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dmabuf_vunmap "drm_gem_dmabuf_vunmap"). Userspace mmap support is provided by
[`drm_gem_dmabuf_mmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_dmabuf_mmap "drm_gem_dmabuf_mmap").

Note that these export helpers can only be used if the underlying backing
storage is fully coherent and either permanently pinned, or it is safe to pin
it indefinitely.

FIXME: The underlying helper functions are named rather inconsistently.

#### Importing buffers

Importing dma-bufs using [`drm_gem_prime_import()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_prime_import "drm_gem_prime_import") relies on
[`drm_driver.gem_prime_import_sg_table`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver").

Note that similarly to the export helpers this permanently pins the
underlying backing storage. Which is ok for scanout, but is not the best
option for sharing lots of buffers for rendering.

using the PRIME helpers. It is used as the default in
[`drm_gem_prime_handle_to_fd()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_prime_handle_to_fd "drm_gem_prime_handle_to_fd").

**Description**

This is the core of [`drm_gem_prime_import()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_prime_import "drm_gem_prime_import"). It's designed to be called by
drivers who want to use a different device structure than [`drm_device.dev`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_device "drm_device") for
attaching via dma_buf. This function calls
[`drm_driver.gem_prime_import_sg_table`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") internally.

Drivers must arrange to call [`drm_prime_gem_destroy()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_prime_gem_destroy "drm_prime_gem_destroy") from their
[`drm_gem_object_funcs.free`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_funcs "drm_gem_object_funcs") hook when using this function.

:   drm_device to import into

`struct dma_buf *dma_buf`
:   dma-buf object to import

**Description**

This is the implementation of the gem_prime_import functions for GEM drivers
using the PRIME helpers. Drivers can use this as their
[`drm_driver.gem_prime_import`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver") implementation. It is used as the default
implementation in [`drm_gem_prime_fd_to_handle()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_prime_fd_to_handle "drm_gem_prime_fd_to_handle").

Drivers must arrange to call [`drm_prime_gem_destroy()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_prime_gem_destroy "drm_prime_gem_destroy") from their
[`drm_gem_object_funcs.free`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object_funcs "drm_gem_object_funcs") hook when using this function.

**Description**

Exports an sg table into an array of pages.

This function is deprecated and strongly discouraged to be used.
The page array is only useful for page faults and those can corrupt fields

:   array to store the dma bus address of each page

`int max_entries`
:   size of both the passed-in arrays

**Description**

Exports an sg table into an array of addresses.

Drivers should use this in their [`drm_driver.gem_prime_import_sg_table`](drm-internals.md#c.drm_driver "drm_driver")
implementation.

void drm_prime_gem_destroy(struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj, struct sg_table \*sg)

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   GEM object which was created from a dma-buf

`struct sg_table *sg`
:   the sg-table which was pinned at import time

**Description**

This is the cleanup functions which GEM drivers need to call when they use
[`drm_gem_prime_import()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_prime_import "drm_gem_prime_import") or [`drm_gem_prime_import_dev()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_prime_import_dev "drm_gem_prime_import_dev") to import dma-bufs.

## DRM MM Range Allocator

### Overview

drm_mm provides a simple range allocator. The drivers are free to use the
resource allocator from the linux core if it suits them, the upside of drm_mm
is that it's in the DRM core. Which means that it's easier to extend for
some of the crazier special purpose needs of gpus.

The main data struct is [`drm_mm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm"), allocations are tracked in [`drm_mm_node`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node").
Drivers are free to embed either of them into their own suitable
datastructures. drm_mm itself will not do any memory allocations of its own,
so if drivers choose not to embed nodes they need to still allocate them
themselves.

The range allocator also supports reservation of preallocated blocks. This is
useful for taking over initial mode setting configurations from the firmware,
where an object needs to be created which exactly matches the firmware's
scanout target. As long as the range is still free it can be inserted anytime
after the allocator is initialized, which helps with avoiding looped
dependencies in the driver load sequence.

drm_mm maintains a stack of most recently freed holes, which of all
simplistic datastructures seems to be a fairly decent approach to clustering
allocations and avoiding too much fragmentation. This means free space
searches are O(num_holes). Given that all the fancy features drm_mm supports
something better would be fairly complex and since gfx thrashing is a fairly
steep cliff not a real concern. Removing a node again is O(1).

drm_mm supports a few features: Alignment and range restrictions can be
supplied. Furthermore every [`drm_mm_node`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") has a color value (which is just an
opaque unsigned long) which in conjunction with a driver callback can be used
to implement sophisticated placement restrictions. The i915 DRM driver uses
this to implement guard pages between incompatible caching domains in the
graphics TT.

Two behaviors are supported for searching and allocating: bottom-up and
top-down. The default is bottom-up. Top-down allocation can be used if the
memory area has different restrictions, or just to reduce fragmentation.

Finally iteration helpers to walk all nodes and all holes are provided as are
some basic allocator dumpers for debugging.

Note that this range allocator is not thread-safe, drivers need to protect
modifications with their own locking. The idea behind this is that for a full
memory manager additional data needs to be protected anyway, hence internal
locking would be fully redundant.

### LRU Scan/Eviction Support

Very often GPUs need to have continuous allocations for a given object. When
evicting objects to make space for a new one it is therefore not most
efficient when we simply start to select all objects from the tail of an LRU
until there's a suitable hole: Especially for big objects or nodes that
otherwise have special allocation constraints there's a good chance we evict
lots of (smaller) objects unnecessarily.

The DRM range allocator supports this use-case through the scanning
interfaces. First a scan operation needs to be initialized with
[`drm_mm_scan_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan_init "drm_mm_scan_init") or [`drm_mm_scan_init_with_range()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan_init_with_range "drm_mm_scan_init_with_range"). The driver adds
objects to the roster, probably by walking an LRU list, but this can be
freely implemented. Eviction candidates are added using
[`drm_mm_scan_add_block()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan_add_block "drm_mm_scan_add_block") until a suitable hole is found or there are no
further evictable objects. Eviction roster metadata is tracked in [`struct
drm_mm_scan`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan "drm_mm_scan").

The driver must walk through all objects again in exactly the reverse
order to restore the allocator state. Note that while the allocator is used
in the scan mode no other operation is allowed.

Finally the driver evicts all objects selected ([`drm_mm_scan_remove_block()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan_remove_block "drm_mm_scan_remove_block")
reported true) in the scan, and any overlapping nodes after color adjustment
([`drm_mm_scan_color_evict()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan_color_evict "drm_mm_scan_color_evict")). Adding and removing an object is O(1), and
since freeing a node is also O(1) the overall complexity is
O(scanned_objects). So like the free stack which needs to be walked before a
scan operation even begins this is linear in the number of objects. It
doesn't seem to hurt too badly.

### DRM MM Range Allocator Function References

enum drm_mm_insert_mode
:   control search and allocation behaviour

**Constants**

`DRM_MM_INSERT_BEST`
:   Search for the smallest hole (within the search range) that fits
    the desired node.

    Allocates the node from the bottom of the found hole.

`DRM_MM_INSERT_LOW`
:   Search for the lowest hole (address closest to 0, within the search
    range) that fits the desired node.

    Allocates the node from the bottom of the found hole.

`DRM_MM_INSERT_HIGH`
:   Search for the highest hole (address closest to U64_MAX, within the
    search range) that fits the desired node.

    Allocates the node from the *top* of the found hole. The specified
    alignment for the node is applied to the base of the node
    ([`drm_mm_node.start`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node")).

`DRM_MM_INSERT_EVICT`
:   Search for the most recently evicted hole (within the search range)
    that fits the desired node. This is appropriate for use immediately
    after performing an eviction scan (see [`drm_mm_scan_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan_init "drm_mm_scan_init")) and
    removing the selected nodes to form a hole.

    Allocates the node from the bottom of the found hole.

`DRM_MM_INSERT_ONCE`
:   Only check the first hole for suitablity and report -ENOSPC
    immediately otherwise, rather than check every hole until a
    suitable one is found. Can only be used in conjunction with another
    search method such as DRM_MM_INSERT_HIGH or DRM_MM_INSERT_LOW.

`DRM_MM_INSERT_HIGHEST`
:   Only check the highest hole (the hole with the largest address) and
    insert the node at the top of the hole or report -ENOSPC if
    unsuitable.

    Does not search all holes.

`DRM_MM_INSERT_LOWEST`
:   Only check the lowest hole (the hole with the smallest address) and
    insert the node at the bottom of the hole or report -ENOSPC if
    unsuitable.

    Does not search all holes.

**Description**

The [`struct drm_mm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") range manager supports finding a suitable modes using
a number of search trees. These trees are oranised by size, by address and
in most recent eviction order. This allows the user to find either the
smallest hole to reuse, the lowest or highest address to reuse, or simply
reuse the most recent eviction that fits. When allocating the [`drm_mm_node`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node")
from within the hole, the [`drm_mm_insert_mode`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_insert_mode "drm_mm_insert_mode") also dictate whether to
allocate the lowest matching address or the highest.

struct drm_mm_node
:   allocated block in the DRM allocator

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_mm_node {
    unsigned long color;
    u64 start;
    u64 size;
};
```

**Members**

`color`
:   Opaque driver-private tag.

`start`
:   Start address of the allocated block.

`size`
:   Size of the allocated block.

**Description**

This represents an allocated block in a [`drm_mm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") allocator. Except for
pre-reserved nodes inserted using [`drm_mm_reserve_node()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_reserve_node "drm_mm_reserve_node") the structure is
entirely opaque and should only be accessed through the provided funcions.
Since allocation of these nodes is entirely handled by the driver they can be
embedded.

struct drm_mm
:   DRM allocator

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_mm {
    void (*color_adjust)(const struct drm_mm_node *node,unsigned long color, u64 *start, u64 *end);
};
```

**Members**

`color_adjust`
:   Optional driver callback to further apply restrictions on a hole. The
    node argument points at the node containing the hole from which the
    block would be allocated (see [`drm_mm_hole_follows()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_hole_follows "drm_mm_hole_follows") and friends). The
    other arguments are the size of the block to be allocated. The driver
    can adjust the start and end as needed to e.g. insert guard pages.

**Description**

DRM range allocator with a few special functions and features geared towards
managing GPU memory. Except for the **color_adjust** callback the structure is
entirely opaque and should only be accessed through the provided functions
and macros. This structure can be embedded into larger driver structures.

struct drm_mm_scan
:   DRM allocator eviction roaster data

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_mm_scan {
};
```

**Members**

**Description**

This structure tracks data needed for the eviction roaster set up using
[`drm_mm_scan_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan_init "drm_mm_scan_init"), and used with [`drm_mm_scan_add_block()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan_add_block "drm_mm_scan_add_block") and
[`drm_mm_scan_remove_block()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan_remove_block "drm_mm_scan_remove_block"). The structure is entirely opaque and should only
be accessed through the provided functions and macros. It is meant to be
allocated temporarily by the driver on the stack.

bool drm_mm_node_allocated(const struct [drm_mm_node](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") \*node)
:   checks whether a node is allocated

**Parameters**

`const struct drm_mm_node *node`
:   drm_mm_node to check

**Description**

Drivers are required to clear a node prior to using it with the
drm_mm range manager.

Drivers should use this helper for proper encapsulation of drm_mm
internals.

**Return**

True if the **node** is allocated.

bool drm_mm_initialized(const struct [drm_mm](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") \*mm)
:   checks whether an allocator is initialized

**Parameters**

`const struct drm_mm *mm`
:   drm_mm to check

**Description**

Drivers should clear the [`struct drm_mm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") prior to initialisation if they
want to use this function.

Drivers should use this helper for proper encapsulation of drm_mm
internals.

**Return**

True if the **mm** is initialized.

bool drm_mm_hole_follows(const struct [drm_mm_node](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") \*node)
:   checks whether a hole follows this node

**Parameters**

`const struct drm_mm_node *node`
:   drm_mm_node to check

**Description**

Holes are embedded into the drm_mm using the tail of a drm_mm_node.
If you wish to know whether a hole follows this particular node,
query this function. See also [`drm_mm_hole_node_start()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_hole_node_start "drm_mm_hole_node_start") and
[`drm_mm_hole_node_end()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_hole_node_end "drm_mm_hole_node_end").

**Return**

True if a hole follows the **node**.

u64 drm_mm_hole_node_start(const struct [drm_mm_node](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") \*hole_node)
:   computes the start of the hole following **node**

**Parameters**

`const struct drm_mm_node *hole_node`
:   drm_mm_node which implicitly tracks the following hole

**Description**

This is useful for driver-specific debug dumpers. Otherwise drivers should
not inspect holes themselves. Drivers must check first whether a hole indeed
follows by looking at [`drm_mm_hole_follows()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_hole_follows "drm_mm_hole_follows")

**Return**

Start of the subsequent hole.

u64 drm_mm_hole_node_end(const struct [drm_mm_node](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") \*hole_node)
:   computes the end of the hole following **node**

**Parameters**

`const struct drm_mm_node *hole_node`
:   drm_mm_node which implicitly tracks the following hole

**Description**

This is useful for driver-specific debug dumpers. Otherwise drivers should
not inspect holes themselves. Drivers must check first whether a hole indeed
follows by looking at [`drm_mm_hole_follows()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_hole_follows "drm_mm_hole_follows").

**Return**

End of the subsequent hole.

drm_mm_nodes

`drm_mm_nodes (mm)`

> list of nodes under the drm_mm range manager

**Parameters**

`mm`
:   the [`struct drm_mm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") range manager

**Description**

As the drm_mm range manager hides its node_list deep with its
structure, extracting it looks painful and repetitive. This is
not expected to be used outside of the [`drm_mm_for_each_node()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_for_each_node "drm_mm_for_each_node")
macros and similar internal functions.

**Return**

The node list, may be empty.

drm_mm_for_each_node

`drm_mm_for_each_node (entry, mm)`

> iterator to walk over all allocated nodes

**Parameters**

`entry`
:   [`struct drm_mm_node`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") to assign to in each iteration step

`mm`
:   [`drm_mm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") allocator to walk

**Description**

This iterator walks over all nodes in the range allocator. It is implemented
with [`list_for_each()`](../core-api/kernel-api.md#c.list_for_each "list_for_each"), so not save against removal of elements.

drm_mm_for_each_node_safe

`drm_mm_for_each_node_safe (entry, next, mm)`

> iterator to walk over all allocated nodes

**Parameters**

`entry`
:   [`struct drm_mm_node`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") to assign to in each iteration step

`next`
:   [`struct drm_mm_node`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") to store the next step

`mm`
:   [`drm_mm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") allocator to walk

**Description**

This iterator walks over all nodes in the range allocator. It is implemented
with [`list_for_each_safe()`](../core-api/kernel-api.md#c.list_for_each_safe "list_for_each_safe"), so save against removal of elements.

drm_mm_for_each_hole

`drm_mm_for_each_hole (pos, mm, hole_start, hole_end)`

> iterator to walk over all holes

**Parameters**

`pos`
:   [`drm_mm_node`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") used internally to track progress

`mm`
:   [`drm_mm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") allocator to walk

`hole_start`
:   ulong variable to assign the hole start to on each iteration

`hole_end`
:   ulong variable to assign the hole end to on each iteration

**Description**

This iterator walks over all holes in the range allocator. It is implemented
with [`list_for_each()`](../core-api/kernel-api.md#c.list_for_each "list_for_each"), so not save against removal of elements. **entry** is used
internally and will not reflect a real drm_mm_node for the very first hole.
Hence users of this iterator may not access it.

Implementation Note:
We need to inline list_for_each_entry in order to be able to set hole_start
and hole_end on each iteration while keeping the macro sane.

int drm_mm_insert_node_generic(struct [drm_mm](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") \*mm, struct [drm_mm_node](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") \*node, u64 size, u64 alignment, unsigned long color, enum [drm_mm_insert_mode](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_insert_mode "drm_mm_insert_mode") mode)
:   search for space and insert **node**

**Parameters**

`struct drm_mm *mm`
:   drm_mm to allocate from

`struct drm_mm_node *node`
:   preallocate node to insert

`u64 size`
:   size of the allocation

`u64 alignment`
:   alignment of the allocation

`unsigned long color`
:   opaque tag value to use for this node

`enum drm_mm_insert_mode mode`
:   fine-tune the allocation search and placement

**Description**

This is a simplified version of [`drm_mm_insert_node_in_range()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_insert_node_in_range "drm_mm_insert_node_in_range") with no
range restrictions applied.

The preallocated node must be cleared to 0.

**Return**

0 on success, -ENOSPC if there's no suitable hole.

int drm_mm_insert_node(struct [drm_mm](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") \*mm, struct [drm_mm_node](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") \*node, u64 size)
:   search for space and insert **node**

**Parameters**

`struct drm_mm *mm`
:   drm_mm to allocate from

`struct drm_mm_node *node`
:   preallocate node to insert

`u64 size`
:   size of the allocation

**Description**

This is a simplified version of [`drm_mm_insert_node_generic()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_insert_node_generic "drm_mm_insert_node_generic") with **color** set
to 0.

The preallocated node must be cleared to 0.

**Return**

0 on success, -ENOSPC if there's no suitable hole.

bool drm_mm_clean(const struct [drm_mm](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") \*mm)
:   checks whether an allocator is clean

**Parameters**

`const struct drm_mm *mm`
:   drm_mm allocator to check

**Return**

True if the allocator is completely free, false if there's still a node
allocated in it.

drm_mm_for_each_node_in_range

`drm_mm_for_each_node_in_range (node__, mm__, start__, end__)`

> iterator to walk over a range of allocated nodes

**Parameters**

`node__`
:   drm_mm_node structure to assign to in each iteration step

`mm__`
:   drm_mm allocator to walk

`start__`
:   starting offset, the first node will overlap this

`end__`
:   ending offset, the last node will start before this (but may overlap)

**Description**

This iterator walks over all nodes in the range allocator that lie
between **start** and **end**. It is implemented similarly to [`list_for_each()`](../core-api/kernel-api.md#c.list_for_each "list_for_each"),
but using the internal interval tree to accelerate the search for the
starting node, and so not safe against removal of elements. It assumes
that **end** is within (or is the upper limit of) the drm_mm allocator.
If [**start**, **end**] are beyond the range of the drm_mm, the iterator may walk
over the special _unallocated_ [`drm_mm.head_node`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm"), and may even continue
indefinitely.

void drm_mm_scan_init(struct [drm_mm_scan](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan "drm_mm_scan") \*scan, struct [drm_mm](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") \*mm, u64 size, u64 alignment, unsigned long color, enum [drm_mm_insert_mode](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_insert_mode "drm_mm_insert_mode") mode)
:   initialize lru scanning

**Parameters**

`struct drm_mm_scan *scan`
:   scan state

`struct drm_mm *mm`
:   drm_mm to scan

`u64 size`
:   size of the allocation

`u64 alignment`
:   alignment of the allocation

`unsigned long color`
:   opaque tag value to use for the allocation

`enum drm_mm_insert_mode mode`
:   fine-tune the allocation search and placement

**Description**

This is a simplified version of [`drm_mm_scan_init_with_range()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan_init_with_range "drm_mm_scan_init_with_range") with no range
restrictions applied.

This simply sets up the scanning routines with the parameters for the desired
hole.

Warning:
As long as the scan list is non-empty, no other operations than
adding/removing nodes to/from the scan list are allowed.

int drm_mm_reserve_node(struct [drm_mm](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") \*mm, struct [drm_mm_node](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") \*node)
:   insert an pre-initialized node

**Parameters**

`struct drm_mm *mm`
:   drm_mm allocator to insert **node** into

`struct drm_mm_node *node`
:   drm_mm_node to insert

**Description**

This functions inserts an already set-up [`drm_mm_node`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") into the allocator,
meaning that start, size and color must be set by the caller. All other
fields must be cleared to 0. This is useful to initialize the allocator with
preallocated objects which must be set-up before the range allocator can be
set-up, e.g. when taking over a firmware framebuffer.

**Return**

0 on success, -ENOSPC if there's no hole where **node** is.

int drm_mm_insert_node_in_range(struct [drm_mm](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") \*const mm, struct [drm_mm_node](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") \*const node, u64 size, u64 alignment, unsigned long color, u64 range_start, u64 range_end, enum [drm_mm_insert_mode](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_insert_mode "drm_mm_insert_mode") mode)
:   ranged search for space and insert **node**

**Parameters**

`struct drm_mm * const mm`
:   drm_mm to allocate from

`struct drm_mm_node * const node`
:   preallocate node to insert

`u64 size`
:   size of the allocation

`u64 alignment`
:   alignment of the allocation

`unsigned long color`
:   opaque tag value to use for this node

`u64 range_start`
:   start of the allowed range for this node

`u64 range_end`
:   end of the allowed range for this node

`enum drm_mm_insert_mode mode`
:   fine-tune the allocation search and placement

**Description**

The preallocated **node** must be cleared to 0.

**Return**

0 on success, -ENOSPC if there's no suitable hole.

void drm_mm_remove_node(struct [drm_mm_node](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") \*node)
:   Remove a memory node from the allocator.

**Parameters**

`struct drm_mm_node *node`
:   drm_mm_node to remove

**Description**

This just removes a node from its drm_mm allocator. The node does not need to
be cleared again before it can be re-inserted into this or any other drm_mm
allocator. It is a bug to call this function on a unallocated node.

void drm_mm_replace_node(struct [drm_mm_node](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") \*old, struct [drm_mm_node](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") \*new)
:   move an allocation from **old** to **new**

**Parameters**

`struct drm_mm_node *old`
:   drm_mm_node to remove from the allocator

`struct drm_mm_node *new`
:   drm_mm_node which should inherit **old**'s allocation

**Description**

This is useful for when drivers embed the drm_mm_node structure and hence
can't move allocations by reassigning pointers. It's a combination of remove
and insert with the guarantee that the allocation start will match.

void drm_mm_scan_init_with_range(struct [drm_mm_scan](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan "drm_mm_scan") \*scan, struct [drm_mm](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") \*mm, u64 size, u64 alignment, unsigned long color, u64 start, u64 end, enum [drm_mm_insert_mode](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_insert_mode "drm_mm_insert_mode") mode)
:   initialize range-restricted lru scanning

**Parameters**

`struct drm_mm_scan *scan`
:   scan state

`struct drm_mm *mm`
:   drm_mm to scan

`u64 size`
:   size of the allocation

`u64 alignment`
:   alignment of the allocation

`unsigned long color`
:   opaque tag value to use for the allocation

`u64 start`
:   start of the allowed range for the allocation

`u64 end`
:   end of the allowed range for the allocation

`enum drm_mm_insert_mode mode`
:   fine-tune the allocation search and placement

**Description**

This simply sets up the scanning routines with the parameters for the desired
hole.

Warning:
As long as the scan list is non-empty, no other operations than
adding/removing nodes to/from the scan list are allowed.

bool drm_mm_scan_add_block(struct [drm_mm_scan](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan "drm_mm_scan") \*scan, struct [drm_mm_node](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") \*node)
:   add a node to the scan list

**Parameters**

`struct drm_mm_scan *scan`
:   the active drm_mm scanner

`struct drm_mm_node *node`
:   drm_mm_node to add

**Description**

Add a node to the scan list that might be freed to make space for the desired
hole.

**Return**

True if a hole has been found, false otherwise.

bool drm_mm_scan_remove_block(struct [drm_mm_scan](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan "drm_mm_scan") \*scan, struct [drm_mm_node](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") \*node)
:   remove a node from the scan list

**Parameters**

`struct drm_mm_scan *scan`
:   the active drm_mm scanner

`struct drm_mm_node *node`
:   drm_mm_node to remove

**Description**

Nodes **must** be removed in exactly the reverse order from the scan list as
they have been added (e.g. using [`list_add()`](../core-api/kernel-api.md#c.list_add "list_add") as they are added and then
[`list_for_each()`](../core-api/kernel-api.md#c.list_for_each "list_for_each") over that eviction list to remove), otherwise the internal
state of the memory manager will be corrupted.

When the scan list is empty, the selected memory nodes can be freed. An
immediately following drm_mm_insert_node_in_range_generic() or one of the
simpler versions of that function with !DRM_MM_SEARCH_BEST will then return
the just freed block (because it's at the top of the free_stack list).

**Return**

True if this block should be evicted, false otherwise. Will always
return false when no hole has been found.

struct [drm_mm_node](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_node "drm_mm_node") \*drm_mm_scan_color_evict(struct [drm_mm_scan](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm_scan "drm_mm_scan") \*scan)
:   evict overlapping nodes on either side of hole

**Parameters**

`struct drm_mm_scan *scan`
:   drm_mm scan with target hole

**Description**

After completing an eviction scan and removing the selected nodes, we may
need to remove a few more nodes from either side of the target hole if
mm.color_adjust is being used.

**Return**

A node to evict, or NULL if there are no overlapping nodes.

void drm_mm_init(struct [drm_mm](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") \*mm, u64 start, u64 size)
:   initialize a drm-mm allocator

**Parameters**

`struct drm_mm *mm`
:   the drm_mm structure to initialize

`u64 start`
:   start of the range managed by **mm**

`u64 size`
:   end of the range managed by **mm**

**Description**

Note that **mm** must be cleared to 0 before calling this function.

void drm_mm_takedown(struct [drm_mm](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") \*mm)
:   clean up a drm_mm allocator

**Parameters**

`struct drm_mm *mm`
:   drm_mm allocator to clean up

**Description**

Note that it is a bug to call this function on an allocator which is not
clean.

void drm_mm_print(const struct [drm_mm](drm-mm.md#c.drm_mm "drm_mm") \*mm, struct [drm_printer](drm-internals.md#c.drm_printer "drm_printer") \*p)
:   print allocator state

**Parameters**

`const struct drm_mm *mm`
:   drm_mm allocator to print

`struct drm_printer *p`
:   DRM printer to use

## DRM GPUVM

### Overview

The DRM GPU VA Manager, represented by [`struct drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm") keeps track of a
GPU's virtual address (VA) space and manages the corresponding virtual
mappings represented by [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") objects. It also keeps track of the
mapping's backing [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") buffers.

[`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") buffers maintain a list of [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") objects representing
all existent GPU VA mappings using this [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") as backing buffer.

GPU VAs can be flagged as sparse, such that drivers may use GPU VAs to also
keep track of sparse PTEs in order to support Vulkan 'Sparse Resources'.

The GPU VA manager internally uses a rb-tree to manage the
[`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") mappings within a GPU's virtual address space.

The [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm") structure contains a special [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") representing the
portion of VA space reserved by the kernel. This node is initialized together
with the GPU VA manager instance and removed when the GPU VA manager is
destroyed.

In a typical application drivers would embed [`struct drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm") and
[`struct drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") within their own driver specific structures, there won't be
any memory allocations of its own nor memory allocations of [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva")
entries.

The data structures needed to store `drm_gpuvas` within the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm") are
contained within [`struct drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") already. Hence, for inserting [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva")
entries from within dma-fence signalling critical sections it is enough to
pre-allocate the [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") structures.

`drm_gem_objects` which are private to a single VM can share a common
[`dma_resv`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_resv "dma_resv") in order to improve locking efficiency (e.g. with [`drm_exec`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_exec "drm_exec")).
For this purpose drivers must pass a [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") to [`drm_gpuvm_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_init "drm_gpuvm_init"), in
the following called 'resv object', which serves as the container of the
GPUVM's shared [`dma_resv`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_resv "dma_resv"). This resv object can be a driver specific
[`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object"), such as the [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") containing the root page table,
but it can also be a 'dummy' object, which can be allocated with
[`drm_gpuvm_resv_object_alloc()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_resv_object_alloc "drm_gpuvm_resv_object_alloc").

In order to connect a [`struct drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") its backing [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") each
[`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") maintains a list of [`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") structures, and each
[`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") contains a list of [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") structures.

A [`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") is an abstraction that represents a combination of a
[`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm") and a [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object"). Every such combination should be unique.
This is ensured by the API through [`drm_gpuvm_bo_obtain()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo_obtain "drm_gpuvm_bo_obtain") and
[`drm_gpuvm_bo_obtain_prealloc()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo_obtain_prealloc "drm_gpuvm_bo_obtain_prealloc") which first look into the corresponding
[`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") list of `drm_gpuvm_bos` for an existing instance of this
particular combination. If not existent a new instance is created and linked
to the [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object").

[`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") structures, since unique for a given [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm"), are also used
as entry for the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm")'s lists of external and evicted objects. Those
lists are maintained in order to accelerate locking of dma-resv locks and
validation of evicted objects bound in a [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm"). For instance, all
[`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object")'s [`dma_resv`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_resv "dma_resv") of a given [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm") can be locked by calling
[`drm_gpuvm_exec_lock()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_exec_lock "drm_gpuvm_exec_lock"). Once locked drivers can call [`drm_gpuvm_validate()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_validate "drm_gpuvm_validate") in
order to validate all evicted `drm_gem_objects`. It is also possible to lock
additional `drm_gem_objects` by providing the corresponding parameters to
[`drm_gpuvm_exec_lock()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_exec_lock "drm_gpuvm_exec_lock") as well as open code the [`drm_exec`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_exec "drm_exec") loop while making
use of helper functions such as [`drm_gpuvm_prepare_range()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_prepare_range "drm_gpuvm_prepare_range") or
[`drm_gpuvm_prepare_objects()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_prepare_objects "drm_gpuvm_prepare_objects").

Every bound [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") is treated as external object when its [`dma_resv`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_resv "dma_resv")
structure is different than the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm")'s common [`dma_resv`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_resv "dma_resv") structure.

### Split and Merge

Besides its capability to manage and represent a GPU VA space, the
GPU VA manager also provides functions to let the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm") calculate a
sequence of operations to satisfy a given map or unmap request.

Therefore the DRM GPU VA manager provides an algorithm implementing splitting
and merging of existent GPU VA mappings with the ones that are requested to
be mapped or unmapped. This feature is required by the Vulkan API to
implement Vulkan 'Sparse Memory Bindings' - drivers UAPIs often refer to this
as VM BIND.

Drivers can call [`drm_gpuvm_sm_map()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map "drm_gpuvm_sm_map") to receive a sequence of callbacks
containing map, unmap and remap operations for a given newly requested
mapping. The sequence of callbacks represents the set of operations to
execute in order to integrate the new mapping cleanly into the current state
of the GPU VA space.

Depending on how the new GPU VA mapping intersects with the existent mappings
of the GPU VA space the [`drm_gpuvm_ops`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_ops "drm_gpuvm_ops") callbacks contain an arbitrary amount
of unmap operations, a maximum of two remap operations and a single map
operation. The caller might receive no callback at all if no operation is
required, e.g. if the requested mapping already exists in the exact same way.

The single map operation represents the original map operation requested by
the caller.

[`drm_gpuva_op_unmap`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_op_unmap "drm_gpuva_op_unmap") contains a 'keep' field, which indicates whether the
[`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") to unmap is physically contiguous with the original mapping
request. Optionally, if 'keep' is set, drivers may keep the actual page table
entries for this [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva"), adding the missing page table entries only and
update the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm")'s view of things accordingly.

Drivers may do the same optimization, namely delta page table updates, also
for remap operations. This is possible since [`drm_gpuva_op_remap`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_op_remap "drm_gpuva_op_remap") consists of
one unmap operation and one or two map operations, such that drivers can
derive the page table update delta accordingly.

Note that there can't be more than two existent mappings to split up, one at
the beginning and one at the end of the new mapping, hence there is a
maximum of two remap operations.

Analogous to [`drm_gpuvm_sm_map()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map "drm_gpuvm_sm_map") [`drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap "drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap") uses [`drm_gpuvm_ops`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_ops "drm_gpuvm_ops") to
call back into the driver in order to unmap a range of GPU VA space. The
logic behind this function is way simpler though: For all existent mappings
enclosed by the given range unmap operations are created. For mappings which
are only partically located within the given range, remap operations are
created such that those mappings are split up and re-mapped partically.

As an alternative to [`drm_gpuvm_sm_map()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map "drm_gpuvm_sm_map") and [`drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap "drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap"),
[`drm_gpuvm_sm_map_ops_create()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map_ops_create "drm_gpuvm_sm_map_ops_create") and [`drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap_ops_create()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap_ops_create "drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap_ops_create") can be used
to directly obtain an instance of [`struct drm_gpuva_ops`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_ops "drm_gpuva_ops") containing a list of
[`drm_gpuva_op`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_op "drm_gpuva_op"), which can be iterated with [`drm_gpuva_for_each_op()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_for_each_op "drm_gpuva_for_each_op"). This list
contains the [`drm_gpuva_ops`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_ops "drm_gpuva_ops") analogous to the callbacks one would receive when
calling [`drm_gpuvm_sm_map()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map "drm_gpuvm_sm_map") or [`drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap "drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap"). While this way requires
more memory (to allocate the [`drm_gpuva_ops`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_ops "drm_gpuva_ops")), it provides drivers a way to
iterate the [`drm_gpuva_op`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_op "drm_gpuva_op") multiple times, e.g. once in a context where memory
allocations are possible (e.g. to allocate GPU page tables) and once in the
dma-fence signalling critical path.

To update the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm")'s view of the GPU VA space [`drm_gpuva_insert()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_insert "drm_gpuva_insert") and
[`drm_gpuva_remove()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_remove "drm_gpuva_remove") may be used. These functions can safely be used from
[`drm_gpuvm_ops`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_ops "drm_gpuvm_ops") callbacks originating from [`drm_gpuvm_sm_map()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map "drm_gpuvm_sm_map") or
[`drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap "drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap"). However, it might be more convenient to use the
provided helper functions [`drm_gpuva_map()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_map "drm_gpuva_map"), [`drm_gpuva_remap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_remap "drm_gpuva_remap") and
[`drm_gpuva_unmap()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_unmap "drm_gpuva_unmap") instead.

The following diagram depicts the basic relationships of existent GPU VA
mappings, a newly requested mapping and the resulting mappings as implemented
by [`drm_gpuvm_sm_map()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map "drm_gpuvm_sm_map") - it doesn't cover any arbitrary combinations of these.

1. Requested mapping is identical. Replace it, but indicate the backing PTEs
   could be kept.

   ```
        0     a     1
   old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

        0     a     1
   req: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

        0     a     1
   new: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
   ```
2. Requested mapping is identical, except for the BO offset, hence replace
   the mapping.

   ```
        0     a     1
   old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

        0     a     1
   req: |-----------| (bo_offset=m)

        0     a     1
   new: |-----------| (bo_offset=m)
   ```
3. Requested mapping is identical, except for the backing BO, hence replace
   the mapping.

   ```
        0     a     1
   old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

        0     b     1
   req: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

        0     b     1
   new: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
   ```
4. Existent mapping is a left aligned subset of the requested one, hence
   replace the existent one.

   ```
        0  a  1
   old: |-----|       (bo_offset=n)

        0     a     2
   req: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

        0     a     2
   new: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
   ```

   > **Note:**
   >
   > We expect to see the same result for a request with a different BO
   > and/or non-contiguous BO offset.
5. Requested mapping's range is a left aligned subset of the existent one,
   but backed by a different BO. Hence, map the requested mapping and split
   the existent one adjusting its BO offset.

   ```
        0     a     2
   old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

        0  b  1
   req: |-----|       (bo_offset=n)

        0  b  1  a' 2
   new: |-----|-----| (b.bo_offset=n, a.bo_offset=n+1)
   ```

   > **Note:**
   >
   > We expect to see the same result for a request with a different BO
   > and/or non-contiguous BO offset.
6. Existent mapping is a superset of the requested mapping. Split it up, but
   indicate that the backing PTEs could be kept.

   ```
        0     a     2
   old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

        0  a  1
   req: |-----|       (bo_offset=n)

        0  a  1  a' 2
   new: |-----|-----| (a.bo_offset=n, a'.bo_offset=n+1)
   ```
7. Requested mapping's range is a right aligned subset of the existent one,
   but backed by a different BO. Hence, map the requested mapping and split
   the existent one, without adjusting the BO offset.

   ```
        0     a     2
   old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

              1  b  2
   req:       |-----| (bo_offset=m)

        0  a  1  b  2
   new: |-----|-----| (a.bo_offset=n,b.bo_offset=m)
   ```
8. Existent mapping is a superset of the requested mapping. Split it up, but
   indicate that the backing PTEs could be kept.

   ```
         0     a     2
   old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

              1  a  2
   req:       |-----| (bo_offset=n+1)

        0  a' 1  a  2
   new: |-----|-----| (a'.bo_offset=n, a.bo_offset=n+1)
   ```
9. Existent mapping is overlapped at the end by the requested mapping backed
   by a different BO. Hence, map the requested mapping and split up the
   existent one, without adjusting the BO offset.

   ```
        0     a     2
   old: |-----------|       (bo_offset=n)

              1     b     3
   req:       |-----------| (bo_offset=m)

        0  a  1     b     3
   new: |-----|-----------| (a.bo_offset=n,b.bo_offset=m)
   ```
10. Existent mapping is overlapped by the requested mapping, both having the
    same backing BO with a contiguous offset. Indicate the backing PTEs of
    the old mapping could be kept.

    ```
         0     a     2
    old: |-----------|       (bo_offset=n)

               1     a     3
    req:       |-----------| (bo_offset=n+1)

         0  a' 1     a     3
    new: |-----|-----------| (a'.bo_offset=n, a.bo_offset=n+1)
    ```
11. Requested mapping's range is a centered subset of the existent one
    having a different backing BO. Hence, map the requested mapping and split
    up the existent one in two mappings, adjusting the BO offset of the right
    one accordingly.

    ```
         0        a        3
    old: |-----------------| (bo_offset=n)

               1  b  2
    req:       |-----|       (bo_offset=m)

         0  a  1  b  2  a' 3
    new: |-----|-----|-----| (a.bo_offset=n,b.bo_offset=m,a'.bo_offset=n+2)
    ```
12. Requested mapping is a contiguous subset of the existent one. Split it
    up, but indicate that the backing PTEs could be kept.

    ```
         0        a        3
    old: |-----------------| (bo_offset=n)

               1  a  2
    req:       |-----|       (bo_offset=n+1)

         0  a' 1  a  2 a'' 3
    old: |-----|-----|-----| (a'.bo_offset=n, a.bo_offset=n+1, a''.bo_offset=n+2)
    ```
13. Existent mapping is a right aligned subset of the requested one, hence
    replace the existent one.

    ```
               1  a  2
    old:       |-----| (bo_offset=n+1)

         0     a     2
    req: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

         0     a     2
    new: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
    ```

    > **Note:**
    >
    > We expect to see the same result for a request with a different bo
    > and/or non-contiguous bo_offset.
14. Existent mapping is a centered subset of the requested one, hence
    replace the existent one.

    ```
               1  a  2
    old:       |-----| (bo_offset=n+1)

         0        a       3
    req: |----------------| (bo_offset=n)

         0        a       3
    new: |----------------| (bo_offset=n)
    ```

    > **Note:**
    >
    > We expect to see the same result for a request with a different bo
    > and/or non-contiguous bo_offset.
15. Existent mappings is overlapped at the beginning by the requested mapping
    backed by a different BO. Hence, map the requested mapping and split up
    the existent one, adjusting its BO offset accordingly.

    ```
               1     a     3
    old:       |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

         0     b     2
    req: |-----------|       (bo_offset=m)

         0     b     2  a' 3
    new: |-----------|-----| (b.bo_offset=m,a.bo_offset=n+2)
    ```

### Locking

In terms of managing [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") entries DRM GPUVM does not take care of
locking itself, it is the drivers responsibility to take care about locking.
Drivers might want to protect the following operations: inserting, removing
and iterating [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") objects as well as generating all kinds of
operations, such as split / merge or prefetch.

DRM GPUVM also does not take care of the locking of the backing
[`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") buffers GPU VA lists and [`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") abstractions by
itself; drivers are responsible to enforce mutual exclusion using either the
GEMs dma_resv lock or alternatively a driver specific external lock. For the
latter see also [`drm_gem_gpuva_set_lock()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_gpuva_set_lock "drm_gem_gpuva_set_lock").

However, DRM GPUVM contains lockdep checks to ensure callers of its API hold
the corresponding lock whenever the `drm_gem_objects` GPU VA list is accessed
by functions such as [`drm_gpuva_link()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_link "drm_gpuva_link") or [`drm_gpuva_unlink()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_unlink "drm_gpuva_unlink"), but also
[`drm_gpuvm_bo_obtain()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo_obtain "drm_gpuvm_bo_obtain") and [`drm_gpuvm_bo_put()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo_put "drm_gpuvm_bo_put").

The latter is required since on creation and destruction of a [`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo")
the [`drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") is attached / removed from the `drm_gem_objects` gpuva list.
Subsequent calls to [`drm_gpuvm_bo_obtain()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo_obtain "drm_gpuvm_bo_obtain") for the same [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm") and
[`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") must be able to observe previous creations and destructions
of `drm_gpuvm_bos` in order to keep instances unique.

The [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm")'s lists for keeping track of external and evicted objects are
protected against concurrent insertion / removal and iteration internally.

However, drivers still need ensure to protect concurrent calls to functions
iterating those lists, namely [`drm_gpuvm_prepare_objects()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_prepare_objects "drm_gpuvm_prepare_objects") and
[`drm_gpuvm_validate()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_validate "drm_gpuvm_validate").

Alternatively, drivers can set the `DRM_GPUVM_RESV_PROTECTED` flag to indicate
that the corresponding [`dma_resv`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_resv "dma_resv") locks are held in order to protect the
lists. If `DRM_GPUVM_RESV_PROTECTED` is set, internal locking is disabled and
the corresponding lockdep checks are enabled. This is an optimization for
drivers which are capable of taking the corresponding [`dma_resv`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_resv "dma_resv") locks and
hence do not require internal locking.

### Examples

This section gives two examples on how to let the DRM GPUVA Manager generate
[`drm_gpuva_op`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_op "drm_gpuva_op") in order to satisfy a given map or unmap request and how to
make use of them.

The below code is strictly limited to illustrate the generic usage pattern.
To maintain simplicitly, it doesn't make use of any abstractions for common
code, different (asyncronous) stages with fence signalling critical paths,
any other helpers or error handling in terms of freeing memory and dropping
previously taken locks.

1. Obtain a list of [`drm_gpuva_op`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_op "drm_gpuva_op") to create a new mapping:

   ```
   // Allocates a new &drm_gpuva.
   struct drm_gpuva * driver_gpuva_alloc(void);

   // Typically drivers would embedd the &drm_gpuvm and &drm_gpuva
   // structure in individual driver structures and lock the dma-resv with
   // drm_exec or similar helpers.
   int driver_mapping_create(struct drm_gpuvm *gpuvm,
                             u64 addr, u64 range,
                             struct drm_gem_object *obj, u64 offset)
   {
           struct drm_gpuva_ops *ops;
           struct drm_gpuva_op *op

**Description**

The DRM GPU VA Manager keeps track of a GPU's virtual address space by using
`maple_tree` structures. Typically, this structure is embedded in bigger
driver structures.

Drivers can pass addresses and ranges in an arbitrary unit, e.g. bytes or
pages.

There should be one manager instance per GPU virtual address space.

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`

drm_gpuvm_for_each_va_range

`drm_gpuvm_for_each_va_range (va__, gpuvm__, start__, end__)`

**Description**

This iterator walks over all `drm_gpuvas` in the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm") that lie
between **start__** and **end__**. It is implemented similarly to [`list_for_each()`](../core-api/kernel-api.md#c.list_for_each "list_for_each"),
but is using the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm")'s internal interval tree to accelerate
the search for the starting [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva"), and hence isn't safe against removal
of elements. It assumes that **end__** is within (or is the upper limit of) the
[`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm"). This iterator does not skip over the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm")'s
**kernel_alloc_node**.

:   [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") to assign to in each iteration step

`next__`
:   another [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") to use as temporary storage

:   [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm") to walk over

`start__`
:   starting offset, the first gpuva will overlap this

`end__`

    overlap)

**Description**

This iterator walks over all `drm_gpuvas` in the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm") that lie
between **start__** and **end__**. It is implemented similarly to
[`list_for_each_safe()`](../core-api/kernel-api.md#c.list_for_each_safe "list_for_each_safe"), but is using the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm")'s internal interval
tree to accelerate the search for the starting [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva"), and hence is safe
against removal of elements. It assumes that **end__** is within (or is the
upper limit of) the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm"). This iterator does not skip over the
[`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm")'s **kernel_alloc_node**.

accelerate validation.

Typically, drivers want to create an instance of a [`struct drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") once
a GEM object is mapped first in a GPU-VM and release the instance once the
last mapping of the GEM object in this GPU-VM is unmapped.

:   structure containing the [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") and it's offset

struct drm_gpuva_op_unmap
:   GPU VA unmap operation

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_gpuva_op_unmap {
    struct drm_gpuva *va;
    bool keep;
};
```

**Members**

`va`
:   the [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") to unmap

`keep`
:   Indicates whether this [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") is physically contiguous with the
    original mapping request.

    Optionally, if `keep` is set, drivers may keep the actual page table
    mappings for this [`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva"), adding the missing page table entries
    only and update the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm") accordingly.

**Description**

DRM GPU VA manager.

struct drm_gpuva_op_remap
:   GPU VA remap operation

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_gpuva_op_remap {
    struct drm_gpuva_op_map *prev;
    struct drm_gpuva_op_map *next;
    struct drm_gpuva_op_unmap *unmap;
};
```

**Members**

`prev`
:   the preceding part of a split mapping

`next`
:   the subsequent part of a split mapping

`unmap`
:   the unmap operation for the original existing mapping

**Description**

This represents a single remap operation generated by the DRM GPU VA manager.

A remap operation is generated when an existing GPU VA mmapping is split up
by inserting a new GPU VA mapping or by partially unmapping existent
mapping(s), hence it consists of a maximum of two map and one unmap
operation.

The **unmap** operation takes care of removing the original existing mapping.
**prev** is used to remap the preceding part, **next** the subsequent part.

If either a new mapping's start address is aligned with the start address
of the old mapping or the new mapping's end address is aligned with the
end address of the old mapping, either **prev** or **next** is NULL.

Note, the reason for a dedicated remap operation, rather than arbitrary
unmap and map operations, is to give drivers the chance of extracting driver
specific data for creating the new mappings from the unmap operations's
[`drm_gpuva`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva "drm_gpuva") structure which typically is embedded in larger driver specific
structures.

    specific structures. By implementing this callback drivers can
    free the previously allocated memory accordingly.

    This callback is optional.

`vm_bo_alloc`
:   called when the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm") allocates
    a [`struct drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo")

    Some drivers may want to embed [`struct drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") into driver
    specific structures. By implementing this callback drivers can
    allocate memory accordingly.

    This callback is optional.

`vm_bo_free`
:   called when the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm") frees a
    [`struct drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo")

    Some drivers may want to embed [`struct drm_gpuvm_bo`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_bo "drm_gpuvm_bo") into driver
    specific structures. By implementing this callback drivers can
    free the previously allocated memory accordingly.

    This callback is optional.

`vm_bo_validate`
:   called from [`drm_gpuvm_validate()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_validate "drm_gpuvm_validate")

    Drivers receive this callback for every evicted [`drm_gem_object`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") being
    mapped in the corresponding [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm").

    Typically, drivers would call their driver specific variant of
    ttm_bo_validate() from within this callback.

`sm_step_map`
:   called from [`drm_gpuvm_sm_map`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map "drm_gpuvm_sm_map") to finally insert the
    mapping once all previous steps were completed

    The `priv` pointer matches the one the driver passed to
    [`drm_gpuvm_sm_map`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map "drm_gpuvm_sm_map") or [`drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap "drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap"), respectively.

`sm_step_remap`
:   called from [`drm_gpuvm_sm_map`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map "drm_gpuvm_sm_map") and
    [`drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap "drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap") to split up an existent mapping

    This callback is called when existent mapping needs to be split up.
    This is the case when either a newly requested mapping overlaps or
    is enclosed by an existent mapping or a partial unmap of an existent
    mapping is requested.

    The `priv` pointer matches the one the driver passed to
    [`drm_gpuvm_sm_map`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map "drm_gpuvm_sm_map") or [`drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap "drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap"), respectively.

    Can be NULL if neither [`drm_gpuvm_sm_map`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map "drm_gpuvm_sm_map") nor [`drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap "drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap") is
    used.

:   called from [`drm_gpuvm_sm_map`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map "drm_gpuvm_sm_map") and
    [`drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap "drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap") to unmap an existent mapping

    This callback is called when existent mapping needs to be unmapped.
    This is the case when either a newly requested mapping encloses an
    existent mapping or an unmap of an existent mapping is requested.

    The `priv` pointer matches the one the driver passed to
    [`drm_gpuvm_sm_map`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map "drm_gpuvm_sm_map") or [`drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap "drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap"), respectively.

    Can be NULL if neither [`drm_gpuvm_sm_map`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_map "drm_gpuvm_sm_map") nor [`drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap "drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap") is

steps.

Drivers may use these callbacks to update the GPU VA space right away within
the callback. In case the driver decides to copy and store the operations for
later processing neither this function nor [`drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap "drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap") is allowed to
be called before the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm")'s view of the GPU VA space was
updated with the previous set of operations. To update the
[`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm")'s view of the GPU VA space [`drm_gpuva_insert()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_insert "drm_gpuva_insert"),
drm_gpuva_destroy_locked() and/or drm_gpuva_destroy_unlocked() should be
used.

A sequence of callbacks can contain map, unmap and remap operations, but
the sequence of callbacks might also be empty if no operation is required,
e.g. if the requested mapping already exists in the exact same way.

There can be an arbitrary amount of unmap operations, a maximum of two remap
operations and a single map operation. The latter one represents the original
map operation requested by the caller.

**Return**

0 on success or a negative error code

of the GPU VA space [`drm_gpuva_insert()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_insert "drm_gpuva_insert"), drm_gpuva_destroy_locked() and/or
drm_gpuva_destroy_unlocked() should be used.

A sequence of callbacks can contain unmap and remap operations, depending on
whether there are actual overlapping mappings to split.

There can be an arbitrary amount of unmap operations and a maximum of two
remap operations.

**Description**

This function creates a list of operations to perform splitting and merging

The list can be iterated with [`drm_gpuva_for_each_op`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_for_each_op "drm_gpuva_for_each_op") and must be processed
in the given order. It can contain map, unmap and remap operations, but it
also can be empty if no operation is required, e.g. if the requested mapping
already exists is the exact same way.

There can be an arbitrary amount of unmap operations, a maximum of two remap
operations and a single map operation. The latter one represents the original
map operation requested by the caller.

Note that before calling this function again with another mapping request it
is necessary to update the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm")'s view of the GPU VA space. The
previously obtained operations must be either processed or abandoned. To

`u64 req_range`
:   the range of the mappings to unmap

**Description**

This function creates a list of operations to perform unmapping and, if

The list can be iterated with [`drm_gpuva_for_each_op`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuva_for_each_op "drm_gpuva_for_each_op") and must be processed
in the given order. It can contain unmap and remap operations, depending on
whether there are actual overlapping mappings to split.

There can be an arbitrary amount of unmap operations and a maximum of two
remap operations.

Note that before calling this function again with another range to unmap it
is necessary to update the [`drm_gpuvm`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpuvm "drm_gpuvm")'s view of the GPU VA space. The

## DRM Sync Objects

DRM synchronisation objects (syncobj, see struct [`drm_syncobj`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_syncobj "drm_syncobj")) provide a
container for a synchronization primitive which can be used by userspace
to explicitly synchronize GPU commands, can be shared between userspace
processes, and can be shared between different DRM drivers.
Their primary use-case is to implement Vulkan fences and semaphores.
The syncobj userspace API provides ioctls for several operations:

> - Creation and destruction of syncobjs
> - Import and export of syncobjs to/from a syncobj file descriptor
> - Import and export a syncobj's underlying fence to/from a sync file
> - Reset a syncobj (set its fence to NULL)
> - Signal a syncobj (set a trivially signaled fence)
> - Wait for a syncobj's fence to appear and be signaled

The syncobj userspace API also provides operations to manipulate a syncobj
in terms of a timeline of struct [`dma_fence_chain`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_fence_chain "dma_fence_chain") rather than a single
struct [`dma_fence`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_fence "dma_fence"), through the following operations:

> - Signal a given point on the timeline
> - Wait for a given point to appear and/or be signaled
> - Import and export from/to a given point of a timeline

At it's core, a syncobj is simply a wrapper around a pointer to a struct
[`dma_fence`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_fence "dma_fence") which may be NULL.
When a syncobj is first created, its pointer is either NULL or a pointer
to an already signaled fence depending on whether the
`DRM_SYNCOBJ_CREATE_SIGNALED` flag is passed to
`DRM_IOCTL_SYNCOBJ_CREATE`.

If the syncobj is considered as a binary (its state is either signaled or
unsignaled) primitive, when GPU work is enqueued in a DRM driver to signal
the syncobj, the syncobj's fence is replaced with a fence which will be
signaled by the completion of that work.
If the syncobj is considered as a timeline primitive, when GPU work is
enqueued in a DRM driver to signal the a given point of the syncobj, a new
struct [`dma_fence_chain`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_fence_chain "dma_fence_chain") pointing to the DRM driver's fence and also
pointing to the previous fence that was in the syncobj. The new struct
[`dma_fence_chain`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_fence_chain "dma_fence_chain") fence replace the syncobj's fence and will be signaled by
completion of the DRM driver's work and also any work associated with the
fence previously in the syncobj.

When GPU work which waits on a syncobj is enqueued in a DRM driver, at the
time the work is enqueued, it waits on the syncobj's fence before
submitting the work to hardware. That fence is either :

> - The syncobj's current fence if the syncobj is considered as a binary
>   primitive.
> - The struct [`dma_fence`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_fence "dma_fence") associated with a given point if the syncobj is
>   considered as a timeline primitive.

If the syncobj's fence is NULL or not present in the syncobj's timeline,
the enqueue operation is expected to fail.

With binary syncobj, all manipulation of the syncobjs's fence happens in
terms of the current fence at the time the ioctl is called by userspace
regardless of whether that operation is an immediate host-side operation
(signal or reset) or or an operation which is enqueued in some driver
queue. `DRM_IOCTL_SYNCOBJ_RESET` and `DRM_IOCTL_SYNCOBJ_SIGNAL` can be used
to manipulate a syncobj from the host by resetting its pointer to NULL or
setting its pointer to a fence which is already signaled.

With a timeline syncobj, all manipulation of the synobj's fence happens in
terms of a u64 value referring to point in the timeline. See
[`dma_fence_chain_find_seqno()`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_fence_chain_find_seqno "dma_fence_chain_find_seqno") to see how a given point is found in the
timeline.

Note that applications should be careful to always use timeline set of
ioctl() when dealing with syncobj considered as timeline. Using a binary
set of ioctl() with a syncobj considered as timeline could result incorrect
synchronization. The use of binary syncobj is supported through the
timeline set of ioctl() by using a point value of 0, this will reproduce
the behavior of the binary set of ioctl() (for example replace the
syncobj's fence when signaling).

### Host-side wait on syncobjs

`DRM_IOCTL_SYNCOBJ_WAIT` takes an array of syncobj handles and does a
host-side wait on all of the syncobj fences simultaneously.
If `DRM_SYNCOBJ_WAIT_FLAGS_WAIT_ALL` is set, the wait ioctl will wait on
all of the syncobj fences to be signaled before it returns.
Otherwise, it returns once at least one syncobj fence has been signaled
and the index of a signaled fence is written back to the client.

Unlike the enqueued GPU work dependencies which fail if they see a NULL
fence in a syncobj, if `DRM_SYNCOBJ_WAIT_FLAGS_WAIT_FOR_SUBMIT` is set,
the host-side wait will first wait for the syncobj to receive a non-NULL
fence and then wait on that fence.
If `DRM_SYNCOBJ_WAIT_FLAGS_WAIT_FOR_SUBMIT` is not set and any one of the
syncobjs in the array has a NULL fence, -EINVAL will be returned.
Assuming the syncobj starts off with a NULL fence, this allows a client
to do a host wait in one thread (or process) which waits on GPU work
submitted in another thread (or process) without having to manually
synchronize between the two.
This requirement is inherited from the Vulkan fence API.

If `DRM_SYNCOBJ_WAIT_FLAGS_WAIT_DEADLINE` is set, the ioctl will also set
a fence deadline hint on the backing fences before waiting, to provide the
fence signaler with an appropriate sense of urgency. The deadline is
specified as an absolute `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` value in units of ns.

Similarly, `DRM_IOCTL_SYNCOBJ_TIMELINE_WAIT` takes an array of syncobj
handles as well as an array of u64 points and does a host-side wait on all
of syncobj fences at the given points simultaneously.

`DRM_IOCTL_SYNCOBJ_TIMELINE_WAIT` also adds the ability to wait for a given
fence to materialize on the timeline without waiting for the fence to be
signaled by using the `DRM_SYNCOBJ_WAIT_FLAGS_WAIT_AVAILABLE` flag. This
requirement is inherited from the wait-before-signal behavior required by
the Vulkan timeline semaphore API.

Alternatively, `DRM_IOCTL_SYNCOBJ_EVENTFD` can be used to wait without
blocking: an eventfd will be signaled when the syncobj is. This is useful to
integrate the wait in an event loop.

### Import/export of syncobjs

`DRM_IOCTL_SYNCOBJ_FD_TO_HANDLE` and `DRM_IOCTL_SYNCOBJ_HANDLE_TO_FD`
provide two mechanisms for import/export of syncobjs.

The first lets the client import or export an entire syncobj to a file
descriptor.
These fd's are opaque and have no other use case, except passing the
syncobj between processes.
All exported file descriptors and any syncobj handles created as a
result of importing those file descriptors own a reference to the
same underlying struct [`drm_syncobj`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_syncobj "drm_syncobj") and the syncobj can be used
persistently across all the processes with which it is shared.
The syncobj is freed only once the last reference is dropped.
Unlike dma-buf, importing a syncobj creates a new handle (with its own
reference) for every import instead of de-duplicating.
The primary use-case of this persistent import/export is for shared
Vulkan fences and semaphores.

The second import/export mechanism, which is indicated by
`DRM_SYNCOBJ_FD_TO_HANDLE_FLAGS_IMPORT_SYNC_FILE` or
`DRM_SYNCOBJ_HANDLE_TO_FD_FLAGS_EXPORT_SYNC_FILE` lets the client
import/export the syncobj's current fence from/to a [`sync_file`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.sync_file "sync_file").
When a syncobj is exported to a sync file, that sync file wraps the
sycnobj's fence at the time of export and any later signal or reset
operations on the syncobj will not affect the exported sync file.
When a sync file is imported into a syncobj, the syncobj's fence is set
to the fence wrapped by that sync file.
Because sync files are immutable, resetting or signaling the syncobj
will not affect any sync files whose fences have been imported into the
syncobj.

### Import/export of timeline points in timeline syncobjs

`DRM_IOCTL_SYNCOBJ_TRANSFER` provides a mechanism to transfer a struct
[`dma_fence_chain`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_fence_chain "dma_fence_chain") of a syncobj at a given u64 point to another u64 point
into another syncobj.

Note that if you want to transfer a struct [`dma_fence_chain`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_fence_chain "dma_fence_chain") from a given
point on a timeline syncobj from/into a binary syncobj, you can use the
point 0 to mean take/replace the fence in the syncobj.

## DRM Execution context

This component mainly abstracts the retry loop necessary for locking
multiple GEM objects while preparing hardware operations (e.g. command
submissions, page table updates etc..).

If a contention is detected while locking a GEM object the cleanup procedure
unlocks all previously locked GEM objects and locks the contended one first
before locking any further objects.

After an object is locked fences slots can optionally be reserved on the
dma_resv object inside the GEM object.

A typical usage pattern should look like this:

```
struct drm_gem_object *obj;
struct drm_exec exec;
unsigned long index;
int ret;

drm_exec_init(&exec, DRM_EXEC_INTERRUPTIBLE_WAIT);
drm_exec_until_all_locked(&exec) {
        ret = drm_exec_prepare_obj(&exec, boA, 1);
        drm_exec_retry_on_contention(&exec);
        if (ret)
                goto error;

        ret = drm_exec_prepare_obj(&exec, boB, 1);
        drm_exec_retry_on_contention(&exec);
        if (ret)
                goto error;
}

drm_exec_for_each_locked_object(&exec, index, obj) {
        dma_resv_add_fence(obj->resv, fence, DMA_RESV_USAGE_READ);
        ...
}
drm_exec_fini(&exec);
```

## GPU Scheduler

### Overview

The GPU scheduler provides entities which allow userspace to push jobs
into software queues which are then scheduled on a hardware run queue.
The software queues have a priority among them. The scheduler selects the entities
from the run queue using a FIFO. The scheduler provides dependency handling
features among jobs. The driver is supposed to provide callback functions for
backend operations to the scheduler like submitting a job to hardware run queue,
returning the dependencies of a job etc.

The organisation of the scheduler is the following:

1. Each hw run queue has one scheduler
2. Each scheduler has multiple run queues with different priorities
   (e.g., HIGH_HW,HIGH_SW, KERNEL, NORMAL)
3. Each scheduler run queue has a queue of entities to schedule
4. Entities themselves maintain a queue of jobs that will be scheduled on
   the hardware.

The jobs in a entity are always scheduled in the order that they were pushed.

Note that once a job was taken from the entities queue and pushed to the
hardware, i.e. the pending queue, the entity must not be referenced anymore
through the jobs entity pointer.

### Flow Control

The DRM GPU scheduler provides a flow control mechanism to regulate the rate
in which the jobs fetched from scheduler entities are executed.

In this context the [`drm_gpu_scheduler`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpu_scheduler "drm_gpu_scheduler") keeps track of a driver specified
credit limit representing the capacity of this scheduler and a credit count;
every [`drm_sched_job`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job "drm_sched_job") carries a driver specified number of credits.

Once a job is executed (but not yet finished), the job's credits contribute
to the scheduler's credit count until the job is finished. If by executing
one more job the scheduler's credit count would exceed the scheduler's
credit limit, the job won't be executed. Instead, the scheduler will wait
until the credit count has decreased enough to not overflow its credit limit.
This implies waiting for previously executed jobs.

Optionally, drivers may register a callback (update_job_credits) provided by
[`struct drm_sched_backend_ops`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_backend_ops "drm_sched_backend_ops") to update the job's credits dynamically. The
scheduler executes this callback every time the scheduler considers a job for
execution and subsequently checks whether the job fits the scheduler's credit
limit.

### Scheduler Function References

DRM_SCHED_FENCE_DONT_PIPELINE

`DRM_SCHED_FENCE_DONT_PIPELINE ()`

> Prefent dependency pipelining

**Parameters**

**Description**

Setting this flag on a scheduler fence prevents pipelining of jobs depending
on this fence. In other words we always insert a full CPU round trip before
dependen jobs are pushed to the hw queue.

DRM_SCHED_FENCE_FLAG_HAS_DEADLINE_BIT

`DRM_SCHED_FENCE_FLAG_HAS_DEADLINE_BIT ()`

> A fence deadline hint has been set

**Parameters**

**Description**

Because we could have a deadline hint can be set before the backing hw
fence is created, we need to keep track of whether a deadline has already
been set.

struct drm_sched_entity
:   A wrapper around a job queue (typically attached to the DRM file_priv).

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_sched_entity {
    struct list_head                list;
    struct drm_sched_rq             *rq;
    struct drm_gpu_scheduler        **sched_list;
    unsigned int                    num_sched_list;
    enum drm_sched_priority         priority;
    spinlock_t rq_lock;
    struct spsc_queue               job_queue;
    atomic_t fence_seq;
    uint64_t fence_context;
    struct dma_fence                *dependency;
    struct dma_fence_cb             cb;

    struct task_struct              *last_user;
    bool stopped;
    struct completion               entity_idle;
    ktime_t oldest_job_waiting;
    struct rb_node                  rb_tree_node;
};
```

**Members**

`list`
:   Used to append this struct to the list of entities in the runqueue
    **rq** under [`drm_sched_rq.entities`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_rq "drm_sched_rq").

    Protected by [`drm_sched_rq.lock`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_rq "drm_sched_rq") of **rq**.

`rq`
:   Runqueue on which this entity is currently scheduled.

    FIXME: Locking is very unclear for this. Writers are protected by
    **rq_lock**, but readers are generally lockless and seem to just race
    with not even a READ_ONCE.

`sched_list`
:   A list of schedulers ([`struct drm_gpu_scheduler`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpu_scheduler "drm_gpu_scheduler")). Jobs from this entity can
    be scheduled on any scheduler on this list.

    This can be modified by calling [`drm_sched_entity_modify_sched()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_entity_modify_sched "drm_sched_entity_modify_sched").
    Locking is entirely up to the driver, see the above function for more
    details.

    This will be set to NULL if `num_sched_list` equals 1 and **rq** has been
    set already.

    FIXME: This means priority changes through
    [`drm_sched_entity_set_priority()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_entity_set_priority "drm_sched_entity_set_priority") will be lost henceforth in this case.

`num_sched_list`
:   Number of drm_gpu_schedulers in the **sched_list**.

`priority`
:   Priority of the entity. This can be modified by calling
    [`drm_sched_entity_set_priority()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_entity_set_priority "drm_sched_entity_set_priority"). Protected by `rq_lock`.

`rq_lock`
:   Lock to modify the runqueue to which this entity belongs.

`job_queue`
:   the list of jobs of this entity.

`fence_seq`
:   A linearly increasing seqno incremented with each new
    [`drm_sched_fence`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_fence "drm_sched_fence") which is part of the entity.

    FIXME: Callers of [`drm_sched_job_arm()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job_arm "drm_sched_job_arm") need to ensure correct locking,
    this doesn't need to be atomic.

`fence_context`
:   A unique context for all the fences which belong to this entity. The
    [`drm_sched_fence.scheduled`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_fence "drm_sched_fence") uses the fence_context but
    [`drm_sched_fence.finished`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_fence "drm_sched_fence") uses fence_context + 1.

`dependency`
:   The dependency fence of the job which is on the top of the job queue.

`cb`
:   Callback for the dependency fence above.

`guilty`
:   Points to entities' guilty.

`last_scheduled`
:   Points to the finished fence of the last scheduled job. Only written
    by the scheduler thread, can be accessed locklessly from
    [`drm_sched_job_arm()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job_arm "drm_sched_job_arm") iff the queue is empty.

`last_user`
:   last group leader pushing a job into the entity.

`stopped`
:   Marks the enity as removed from rq and destined for
    termination. This is set by calling [`drm_sched_entity_flush()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_entity_flush "drm_sched_entity_flush") and by
    [`drm_sched_fini()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_fini "drm_sched_fini").

`entity_idle`
:   Signals when entity is not in use, used to sequence entity cleanup in
    [`drm_sched_entity_fini()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_entity_fini "drm_sched_entity_fini").

`oldest_job_waiting`
:   Marks earliest job waiting in SW queue

`rb_tree_node`
:   The node used to insert this entity into time based priority queue

**Description**

Entities will emit jobs in order to their corresponding hardware
ring, and the scheduler will alternate between entities based on
scheduling policy.

struct drm_sched_rq
:   queue of entities to be scheduled.

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_sched_rq {
    spinlock_t lock;
    struct drm_gpu_scheduler        *sched;
    struct list_head                entities;
    struct drm_sched_entity         *current_entity;

:   list of the entities to be scheduled.

`current_entity`
:   the entity which is to be scheduled.

`rb_tree_root`
:   root of time based priory queue of entities for FIFO scheduling

Run queue is a set of entities scheduling command submissions for
one specific ring. It implements the scheduling policy that selects
the next entity to emit commands from.

struct drm_sched_fence
:   fences corresponding to the scheduling of a job.

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_sched_fence {
    struct dma_fence                scheduled;
    struct dma_fence                finished;
    ktime_t deadline;
    struct dma_fence                *parent;
    struct drm_gpu_scheduler        *sched;

    void *owner;
};
```

**Members**

`scheduled`
:   this fence is what will be signaled by the scheduler
    when the job is scheduled.

`finished`
:   this fence is what will be signaled by the scheduler
    when the job is completed.

    When setting up an out fence for the job, you should use
    this, since it's available immediately upon
    [`drm_sched_job_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job_init "drm_sched_job_init"), and the fence returned by the driver
    from run_job() won't be created until the dependencies have
    resolved.

`deadline`
:   deadline set on [`drm_sched_fence.finished`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_fence "drm_sched_fence") which
    potentially needs to be propagated to [`drm_sched_fence.parent`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_fence "drm_sched_fence")

`parent`
:   the fence returned by [`drm_sched_backend_ops.run_job`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_backend_ops "drm_sched_backend_ops")
    when scheduling the job on hardware. We signal the
    [`drm_sched_fence.finished`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_fence "drm_sched_fence") fence once parent is signalled.

`sched`
:   the scheduler instance to which the job having this struct
    belongs to.

`lock`
:   the lock used by the scheduled and the finished fences.

`owner`
:   job owner for debugging

struct drm_sched_job
:   A job to be run by an entity.

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_sched_job {
    struct spsc_node                queue_node;
    struct list_head                list;
    struct drm_gpu_scheduler        *sched;
    struct drm_sched_fence          *s_fence;
    u32 credits;
    union {
        struct dma_fence_cb             finish_cb;

`id`
:   a unique id assigned to each job scheduled on the scheduler.

    be scheduled further.

`s_priority`
:   the priority of the job.

`entity`
:   the entity to which this job belongs.

`cb`
:   the callback for the parent fence in s_fence.

    [`drm_sched_job_add_dependency()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job_add_dependency "drm_sched_job_add_dependency") and
    [`drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies "drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies").

`last_dependency`
:   tracks **dependencies** as they signal

`submit_ts`
:   When the job was pushed into the entity queue.

**Description**

A job is created by the driver using [`drm_sched_job_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job_init "drm_sched_job_init"), and
should call [`drm_sched_entity_push_job()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_entity_push_job "drm_sched_entity_push_job") once it wants the scheduler
to schedule the job.

struct drm_sched_backend_ops
:   Define the backend operations called by the scheduler

**Definition**:

```
struct drm_sched_backend_ops {
    struct dma_fence *(*prepare_job)(struct drm_sched_job *sched_job, struct drm_sched_entity *s_entity);
    struct dma_fence *(*run_job)(struct drm_sched_job *sched_job);
    enum drm_gpu_sched_stat (*timedout_job)(struct drm_sched_job *sched_job);
    void (*free_job)(struct drm_sched_job *sched_job);
    u32 (*update_job_credits)(struct drm_sched_job *sched_job);
};
```

**Members**

`prepare_job`
:   Called when the scheduler is considering scheduling this job next, to
    get another [`struct dma_fence`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_fence "dma_fence") for this job to block on. Once it
    returns NULL, run_job() may be called.

    Can be NULL if no additional preparation to the dependencies are
    necessary. Skipped when jobs are killed instead of run.

`run_job`
:   Called to execute the job once all of the dependencies
    have been resolved. This may be called multiple times, if
    timedout_job() has happened and drm_sched_job_recovery()
    decides to try it again.

`timedout_job`
:   Called when a job has taken too long to execute,
    to trigger GPU recovery.

    This method is called in a workqueue context.

    Drivers typically issue a reset to recover from GPU hangs, and this
    procedure usually follows the following workflow:

    1. Stop the scheduler using [`drm_sched_stop()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_stop "drm_sched_stop"). This will park the
       scheduler thread and cancel the timeout work, guaranteeing that
       nothing is queued while we reset the hardware queue
    2. Try to gracefully stop non-faulty jobs (optional)
    3. Issue a GPU reset (driver-specific)
    4. Re-submit jobs using [`drm_sched_resubmit_jobs()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_resubmit_jobs "drm_sched_resubmit_jobs")
    5. Restart the scheduler using [`drm_sched_start()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_start "drm_sched_start"). At that point, new
       jobs can be queued, and the scheduler thread is unblocked

    Note that some GPUs have distinct hardware queues but need to reset
    the GPU globally, which requires extra synchronization between the
    timeout handler of the different [`drm_gpu_scheduler`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpu_scheduler "drm_gpu_scheduler"). One way to
    achieve this synchronization is to create an ordered workqueue
    (using [`alloc_ordered_workqueue()`](../core-api/workqueue.md#c.alloc_ordered_workqueue "alloc_ordered_workqueue")) at the driver level, and pass this
    queue to [`drm_sched_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_init "drm_sched_init"), to guarantee that timeout handlers are
    executed sequentially. The above workflow needs to be slightly
    adjusted in that case:

    1. Stop all schedulers impacted by the reset using [`drm_sched_stop()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_stop "drm_sched_stop")
    2. Try to gracefully stop non-faulty jobs on all queues impacted by
       the reset (optional)
    3. Issue a GPU reset on all faulty queues (driver-specific)
    4. Re-submit jobs on all schedulers impacted by the reset using
       [`drm_sched_resubmit_jobs()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_resubmit_jobs "drm_sched_resubmit_jobs")
    5. Restart all schedulers that were stopped in step #1 using
       [`drm_sched_start()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_start "drm_sched_start")

    Return DRM_GPU_SCHED_STAT_NOMINAL, when all is normal,
    and the underlying driver has started or completed recovery.

    Return DRM_GPU_SCHED_STAT_ENODEV, if the device is no longer
    available, i.e. has been unplugged.

`free_job`
:   Called once the job's finished fence has been signaled
    and it's time to clean it up.

`update_job_credits`
:   Called when the scheduler is considering this
    job for execution.

    This callback returns the number of credits the job would take if
    pushed to the hardware. Drivers may use this to dynamically update
    the job's credit count. For instance, deduct the number of credits
    for already signalled native fences.

    This callback is optional.

**Description**

These functions should be implemented in the driver side.

:   - immediately start job timeout handler

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gpu_scheduler *sched`
:   scheduler for which the timeout handling should be started.

**Description**

Start timeout handling immediately for the named scheduler.

void drm_sched_fault(struct [drm_gpu_scheduler](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpu_scheduler "drm_gpu_scheduler") \*sched)
:   immediately start timeout handler

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gpu_scheduler *sched`
:   scheduler where the timeout handling should be started.

**Description**

Start timeout handling immediately when the driver detects a hardware fault.

unsigned long drm_sched_suspend_timeout(struct [drm_gpu_scheduler](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpu_scheduler "drm_gpu_scheduler") \*sched)
:   Suspend scheduler job timeout

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gpu_scheduler *sched`
:   scheduler instance for which to suspend the timeout

**Description**

Suspend the delayed work timeout for the scheduler. This is done by
modifying the delayed work timeout to an arbitrary large value,
MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT in this case.

Returns the timeout remaining

void drm_sched_resume_timeout(struct [drm_gpu_scheduler](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpu_scheduler "drm_gpu_scheduler") \*sched, unsigned long remaining)
:   Resume scheduler job timeout

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gpu_scheduler *sched`
:   scheduler instance for which to resume the timeout

`unsigned long remaining`
:   remaining timeout

**Description**

Resume the delayed work timeout for the scheduler.

void drm_sched_stop(struct [drm_gpu_scheduler](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpu_scheduler "drm_gpu_scheduler") \*sched, struct [drm_sched_job](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job "drm_sched_job") \*bad)
:   stop the scheduler

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gpu_scheduler *sched`
:   scheduler instance

`struct drm_sched_job *bad`
:   job which caused the time out

**Description**

Stop the scheduler and also removes and frees all completed jobs.

**Note**

bad job will not be freed as it might be used later and so it's
callers responsibility to release it manually if it's not part of the
pending list any more.

void drm_sched_start(struct [drm_gpu_scheduler](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpu_scheduler "drm_gpu_scheduler") \*sched, bool full_recovery)
:   recover jobs after a reset

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gpu_scheduler *sched`
:   scheduler instance

`bool full_recovery`
:   proceed with complete sched restart

void drm_sched_resubmit_jobs(struct [drm_gpu_scheduler](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpu_scheduler "drm_gpu_scheduler") \*sched)
:   Deprecated, don't use in new code!

**Parameters**

`struct drm_gpu_scheduler *sched`
:   scheduler instance

**Description**

Re-submitting jobs was a concept AMD came up as cheap way to implement
recovery after a job timeout.

This turned out to be not working very well. First of all there are many
problem with the dma_fence implementation and requirements. Either the
implementation is risking deadlocks with core memory management or violating
documented implementation details of the dma_fence object.

Drivers can still save and restore their state for recovery operations, but
we shouldn't make this a general scheduler feature around the dma_fence
interface.

int drm_sched_job_init(struct [drm_sched_job](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job "drm_sched_job") \*job, struct [drm_sched_entity](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_entity "drm_sched_entity") \*entity, u32 credits, void \*owner)
:   init a scheduler job

**Parameters**

`struct drm_sched_job *job`
:   scheduler job to init

`struct drm_sched_entity *entity`
:   scheduler entity to use

`u32 credits`
:   the number of credits this job contributes to the schedulers
    credit limit

`void *owner`
:   job owner for debugging

**Description**

Refer to [`drm_sched_entity_push_job()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_entity_push_job "drm_sched_entity_push_job") documentation
for locking considerations.

Drivers must make sure [`drm_sched_job_cleanup()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job_cleanup "drm_sched_job_cleanup") if this function returns
successfully, even when **job** is aborted before [`drm_sched_job_arm()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job_arm "drm_sched_job_arm") is called.

WARNING: amdgpu abuses `drm_sched.ready` to signal when the hardware
has died, which can mean that there's no valid runqueue for a **entity**.
This function returns -ENOENT in this case (which probably should be -EIO as
a more meanigful return value).

Returns 0 for success, negative error code otherwise.

void drm_sched_job_arm(struct [drm_sched_job](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job "drm_sched_job") \*job)
:   arm a scheduler job for execution

**Parameters**

`struct drm_sched_job *job`
:   scheduler job to arm

**Description**

This arms a scheduler job for execution. Specifically it initializes the
[`drm_sched_job.s_fence`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job "drm_sched_job") of **job**, so that it can be attached to [`struct dma_resv`](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_resv "dma_resv")
or other places that need to track the completion of this job.

Refer to [`drm_sched_entity_push_job()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_entity_push_job "drm_sched_entity_push_job") documentation for locking
considerations.

This can only be called if [`drm_sched_job_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job_init "drm_sched_job_init") succeeded.

int drm_sched_job_add_dependency(struct [drm_sched_job](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job "drm_sched_job") \*job, struct [dma_fence](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_fence "dma_fence") \*fence)

**Parameters**

`struct drm_sched_job *job`
:   scheduler job to add the dependencies to

`struct dma_fence *fence`
:   the dma_fence to add to the list of dependencies.

**Description**

Note that **fence** is consumed in both the success and error cases.

**Return**

0 on success, or an error on failing to expand the array.

int drm_sched_job_add_syncobj_dependency(struct [drm_sched_job](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job "drm_sched_job") \*job, struct [drm_file](drm-internals.md#c.drm_file "drm_file") \*file, u32 handle, u32 point)
:   adds a syncobj's fence as a job dependency

**Parameters**

`struct drm_sched_job *job`
:   scheduler job to add the dependencies to

`struct drm_file *file`
:   drm file private pointer

`u32 handle`
:   syncobj handle to lookup

**Description**

This adds the fence matching the given syncobj to **job**.

**Return**

0 on success, or an error on failing to expand the array.

int drm_sched_job_add_resv_dependencies(struct [drm_sched_job](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job "drm_sched_job") \*job, struct [dma_resv](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_resv "dma_resv") \*resv, enum [dma_resv_usage](../driver-api/dma-buf.md#c.dma_resv_usage "dma_resv_usage") usage)
:   add all fences from the resv to the job

**Parameters**

`struct drm_sched_job *job`
:   scheduler job to add the dependencies to

`struct dma_resv *resv`
:   the dma_resv object to get the fences from

`enum dma_resv_usage usage`
:   the dma_resv_usage to use to filter the fences

**Description**

This adds all fences matching the given usage from **resv** to **job**.
Must be called with the **resv** lock held.

**Return**

0 on success, or an error on failing to expand the array.

int drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies(struct [drm_sched_job](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job "drm_sched_job") \*job, struct [drm_gem_object](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_object "drm_gem_object") \*obj, bool write)
:   adds implicit dependencies as job dependencies

**Parameters**

`struct drm_sched_job *job`
:   scheduler job to add the dependencies to

`struct drm_gem_object *obj`
:   the gem object to add new dependencies from.

`bool write`
:   whether the job might write the object (so we need to depend on
    shared fences in the reservation object).

**Description**

This should be called after [`drm_gem_lock_reservations()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gem_lock_reservations "drm_gem_lock_reservations") on your array of
GEM objects used in the job but before updating the reservations with your
own fences.

**Return**

0 on success, or an error on failing to expand the array.

void drm_sched_job_cleanup(struct [drm_sched_job](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job "drm_sched_job") \*job)
:   clean up scheduler job resources

**Parameters**

`struct drm_sched_job *job`
:   scheduler job to clean up

**Description**

Cleans up the resources allocated with [`drm_sched_job_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job_init "drm_sched_job_init").

Drivers should call this from their error unwind code if **job** is aborted
before [`drm_sched_job_arm()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job_arm "drm_sched_job_arm") is called.

After that point of no return **job** is committed to be executed by the
scheduler, and this function should be called from the
[`drm_sched_backend_ops.free_job`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_backend_ops "drm_sched_backend_ops") callback.

struct [drm_gpu_scheduler](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpu_scheduler "drm_gpu_scheduler") \*drm_sched_pick_best(struct [drm_gpu_scheduler](drm-mm.md#c.drm_gpu_scheduler "drm_gpu_scheduler") \*\*sched_list, unsigned int num_sched_list)

**Description**

Splitting [`drm_sched_entity_fini()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_entity_fini "drm_sched_entity_fini") into two functions, The first one does the
waiting, removes the entity from the runqueue and returns an error when the
process was killed.

Returns the remaining time in jiffies left from the input timeout

void drm_sched_entity_fini(struct [drm_sched_entity](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_entity "drm_sched_entity") \*entity)

:   scheduler entity

**Description**

Cleanups up **entity** which has been initialized by [`drm_sched_entity_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_entity_init "drm_sched_entity_init").

If there are potentially job still in flight or getting newly queued
[`drm_sched_entity_flush()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_entity_flush "drm_sched_entity_flush") must be called first. This function then goes over
the entity and signals all jobs with an error code if the process was killed.

:   Submit a job to the entity's job queue

**Parameters**

`struct drm_sched_job *sched_job`
:   job to submit

**Note**

To guarantee that the order of insertion to queue matches the job's
fence sequence number this function should be called with [`drm_sched_job_arm()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job_arm "drm_sched_job_arm")
under common lock for the [`struct drm_sched_entity`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_entity "drm_sched_entity") that was set up for
**sched_job** in [`drm_sched_job_init()`](drm-mm.md#c.drm_sched_job_init "drm_sched_job_init").
