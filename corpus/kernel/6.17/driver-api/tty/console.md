## [Struct Console](console.md#id2)

enum cons_flags
:   General console flags

**Constants**

`CON_PRINTBUFFER`
:   Used by newly registered consoles to avoid duplicate
    output of messages that were already shown by boot
    consoles or read by userspace via `syslog()` syscall.

`CON_CONSDEV`
:   Indicates that the console driver is backing
    /dev/console.

`CON_ENABLED`
:   Indicates if a console is allowed to print records. If
    false, the console also will not advance to later
    records.

`CON_BOOT`
:   Marks the console driver as early console driver which
    is used during boot before the real driver becomes
    available. It will be automatically unregistered
    when the real console driver is registered unless
    “keep_bootcon” parameter is used.

`CON_ANYTIME`
:   A misnomed historical flag which tells the core code
    that the legacy **console**::write callback can be invoked
    on a CPU which is marked OFFLINE. That is misleading as
    it suggests that there is no contextual limit for
    invoking the callback. The original motivation was
    readiness of the per-CPU areas.

`CON_BRL`
:   Indicates a braille device which is exempt from
    receiving the printk spam for obvious reasons.

`CON_EXTENDED`
:   The console supports the extended output format of
    /dev/kmesg which requires a larger output buffer.

`CON_SUSPENDED`
:   Indicates if a console is suspended. If true, the
    printing callbacks must not be called.

`CON_NBCON`
:   Console can operate outside of the legacy style console_lock
    constraints.

struct console
:   The console descriptor structure

**Definition**:

```
struct console {
    char name[16];
    void (*write)(struct console *co, const char *s, unsigned int count);
    int (*read)(struct console *co, char *s, unsigned int count);

    struct irq_work         irq_work;
};
```

**Members**

`name`
:   The name of the console driver

`write`
:   Legacy write callback to output messages (Optional)

`read`
:   Read callback for console input (Optional)

`device`
:   The underlying TTY device driver (Optional)

`unblank`
:   Callback to unblank the console (Optional)

`setup`
:   Callback for initializing the console (Optional)

`exit`
:   Callback for teardown of the console (Optional)

`match`
:   Callback for matching a console (Optional)

`flags`
:   Console flags. See [`enum cons_flags`](console.md#c.cons_flags "cons_flags")

`index`
:   Console index, e.g. port number

`cflag`
:   TTY control mode flags

`ispeed`
:   TTY input speed

`ospeed`
:   TTY output speed

`seq`
:   Sequence number of the next ringbuffer record to print

`dropped`
:   Number of unreported dropped ringbuffer records

`data`
:   Driver private data

`node`
:   hlist node for the console list

`write_atomic`
:   NBCON callback to write out text in any context. (Optional)

    This callback is called with the console already acquired. However,
    a higher priority context is allowed to take it over by default.

    The callback must call `nbcon_enter_unsafe()` and `nbcon_exit_unsafe()`
    around any code where the takeover is not safe, for example, when
    manipulating the serial port registers.

    `nbcon_enter_unsafe()` will fail if the context has lost the console
    ownership in the meantime. In this case, the callback is no longer
    allowed to go forward. It must back out immediately and carefully.
    The buffer content is also no longer trusted since it no longer
    belongs to the context.

    The callback should allow the takeover whenever it is safe. It
    increases the chance to see messages when the system is in trouble.
    If the driver must reacquire ownership in order to finalize or
    revert hardware changes, `nbcon_reacquire_nobuf()` can be used.
    However, on reacquire the buffer content is no longer available. A
    reacquire cannot be used to resume printing.

    The callback can be called from any context (including NMI).
    Therefore it must avoid usage of any locking and instead rely
    on the console ownership for synchronization.

`write_thread`
:   NBCON callback to write out text in task context.

    This callback must be called only in task context with both
    `device_lock()` and the nbcon console acquired with
    NBCON_PRIO_NORMAL.

    The same rules for console ownership verification and unsafe
    sections handling applies as with `write_atomic()`.

    The console ownership handling is necessary for synchronization
    against `write_atomic()` which is synchronized only via the context.

    The `device_lock()` provides the primary serialization for operations
    on the device. It might be as relaxed (mutex)[\*] or as tight
    (disabled preemption and interrupts) as needed. It allows
    the kthread to operate in the least restrictive mode[\*\*].

    [\*] Standalone nbcon_context_try_acquire() is not safe with
    :   the preemption enabled, see `nbcon_owner_matches()`. But it
        can be safe when always called in the preemptive context
        under the `device_lock()`.

    [\*\*] The device_lock() makes sure that nbcon_context_try_acquire()
    :   would never need to spin which is important especially with
        PREEMPT_RT.

`device_lock`
:   NBCON callback to begin synchronization with driver code.

    Console drivers typically must deal with access to the hardware
    via user input/output (such as an interactive login shell) and
    output of kernel messages via [`printk()`](../../core-api/printk-basics.md#c.printk "printk") calls. This callback is
    called by the printk-subsystem whenever it needs to synchronize
    with hardware access by the driver. It should be implemented to
    use whatever synchronization mechanism the driver is using for
    itself (for example, the port lock for uart serial consoles).

    The callback is always called from task context. It may use any
    synchronization method required by the driver.

    IMPORTANT: The callback MUST disable migration. The console driver
    :   may be using a synchronization mechanism that already takes
        care of this (such as spinlocks). Otherwise this function must
        explicitly call `migrate_disable()`.

    The flags argument is provided as a convenience to the driver. It
    will be passed again to `device_unlock()`. It can be ignored if the
    driver does not need it.

`device_unlock`
:   NBCON callback to finish synchronization with driver code.

    It is the counterpart to `device_lock()`.

    This callback is always called from task context. It must
    appropriately re-enable migration (depending on how `device_lock()`
    disabled migration).

    The flags argument is the value of the same variable that was
    passed to `device_lock()`.

`nbcon_state`
:   State for nbcon consoles

`nbcon_seq`
:   Sequence number of the next record for nbcon to print

`nbcon_device_ctxt`
:   Context available for non-printing operations

`nbcon_prev_seq`
:   Seq num the previous nbcon owner was assigned to print

`pbufs`

**Definition**:

```
struct nbcon_state {
    union {
        unsigned int    atom;
        struct {
            unsigned int prio               :  2;
            unsigned int req_prio           :  2;
            unsigned int unsafe             :  1;
            unsigned int unsafe_takeover    :  1;
            unsigned int cpu                : 24;
        };
    };
};
```

`unsafe_takeover`
:   A hostile takeover in an unsafe state happened in the
    past. The console cannot be safe until re-initialized.

`cpu`
:   The CPU on which the owner runs

**Description**

To be used for reading and preparing of the value stored in the nbcon
state variable **console**::nbcon_state.

The **prio** and **req_prio** fields are particularly important to allow
spin-waiting to timeout and give up without the risk of a waiter being
assigned the lock after giving up.

:   Emergency output (WARN/OOPS...)

`NBCON_PRIO_PANIC`
:   Panic output

`NBCON_PRIO_MAX`
:   The number of priority levels

**Description**

A higher priority context can takeover the console when it is
in the safe state. The final attempt to flush consoles in `panic()`
can be allowed to do so even in an unsafe state (Hope and pray).

:   Context for console acquire/release

**Definition**:

```
struct nbcon_context {
    struct console          *console;

## [Console functions](console.md#id5)

short console_srcu_read_flags(const struct [console](console.md#c.console "console") \*con)
:   Locklessly read flags of a possibly registered console

**Parameters**

`const struct console *con`
:   [`struct console`](console.md#c.console "console") pointer of console to read flags from

**Description**

Locklessly reading **con->flags** provides a consistent read value because
there is at most one CPU modifying **con->flags** and that CPU is using only
read-modify-write operations to do so.

Requires console_srcu_read_lock to be held, which implies that **con** might
be a registered console. The purpose of holding console_srcu_read_lock is
to guarantee that the console state is valid (CON_SUSPENDED/CON_ENABLED)
and that no exit/cleanup routines will run if the console is currently
undergoing unregistration.

If the caller is holding the console_list_lock or it is _certain_ that
**con** is not and will not become registered, the caller may read
**con->flags** directly instead.

**Context**

Any context.

**Return**

The current value of the **con->flags** field.

void console_srcu_write_flags(struct [console](console.md#c.console "console") \*con, short flags)
:   Write flags for a registered console

**Parameters**

`struct console *con`
:   [`struct console`](console.md#c.console "console") pointer of console to write flags to

`short flags`
:   new flags value to write

**Description**

Only use this function to write flags for registered consoles. It
requires holding the console_list_lock.

**Context**

Any context.

for_each_console_srcu

`for_each_console_srcu (con)`

> Iterator over registered consoles

**Parameters**

`con`
:   [`struct console`](console.md#c.console "console") pointer used as loop cursor

**Description**

Although SRCU guarantees the console list will be consistent, the
[`struct console`](console.md#c.console "console") fields may be updated by other CPUs while iterating.

Requires console_srcu_read_lock to be held. Can be invoked from
any context.

for_each_console

`for_each_console (con)`

> Iterator over registered consoles

**Parameters**

`con`
:   [`struct console`](console.md#c.console "console") pointer used as loop cursor

**Description**

The console list and the [`console.flags`](console.md#c.console "console") are immutable while iterating.

Requires console_list_lock to be held.

void clear_selection(void)
:   remove current selection

**Parameters**

`void`
:   no arguments

**Description**

Remove the current selection highlight, if any from the console holding the
selection.

Locking: The caller must hold the console lock.

:   resize a VT

**Parameters**

`struct vc_data *vc`
:   virtual console

`unsigned int cols`
:   columns

`unsigned int rows`
:   rows

`bool from_user`
:   invoked by a user?

**Description**

Resize a virtual console as seen from the console end of things. We use the
common [`vc_do_resize()`](console.md#c.vc_do_resize "vc_do_resize") method to update the structures.

Locking: The caller must hold the console sem to protect console internals
and **vc->port.tty**.

int con_is_bound(const struct [consw](console.md#c.consw "consw") \*csw)
:   checks if driver is bound to the console

**Parameters**

`const struct consw *csw`
:   console driver

**Return**

zero if unbound, nonzero if bound

**Description**

Drivers can call this and if zero, they should release
all resources allocated on [`consw.con_startup()`](console.md#c.consw "consw")

bool con_is_visible(const struct vc_data \*vc)
:   checks whether the current console is visible

**Parameters**

`const struct vc_data *vc`
:   virtual console

**Return**

zero if not visible, nonzero if visible

void con_debug_enter(struct vc_data \*vc)
:   prepare the console for the kernel debugger

**Parameters**

`struct vc_data *vc`
:   virtual console

**Description**

Called when the console is taken over by the kernel debugger, this
function needs to save the current console state, then put the console
into a state suitable for the kernel debugger.

void con_debug_leave(void)
:   restore console state

**Parameters**

`void`
:   no arguments

**Description**

Restore the console state to what it was before the kernel debugger
was invoked.

:   unregister console driver from console layer

**Parameters**

`const struct consw *csw`
:   console driver

**Description**

All drivers that registers to the console layer must
call this function upon exit, or if the console driver is in a state
where it won’t be able to handle console services, such as the
framebuffer console without loaded framebuffer drivers.

The driver must unbind first prior to unregistration.

### [Internals](console.md#id6)

int sel_loadlut(u32 __user \*lut)
:   load the LUT table

**Parameters**

`u32 __user *lut`
:   user table

**Description**

Load the LUT table from user space. Make a temporary copy so a partial
update doesn’t make a mess.

Locking: The console lock is acquired.

int set_selection_user(const struct tiocl_selection __user \*sel, struct [tty_struct](tty_struct.md#c.tty_struct "tty_struct") \*tty)
:   set the current selection.

**Parameters**

`const struct tiocl_selection __user *sel`
:   user selection info

`struct tty_struct *tty`
:   the console tty

**Description**

Invoked by the ioctl handle for the vt layer.

Locking: The entire selection process is managed under the console_lock.
It’s a lot under the lock but its hardly a performance path.

int vc_do_resize(struct [tty_struct](tty_struct.md#c.tty_struct "tty_struct") \*tty, struct vc_data \*vc, unsigned int cols, unsigned int lines, bool from_user)
:   resizing method for the tty

`unsigned int cols`
:   columns

`unsigned int lines`
:   lines

`bool from_user`
:   invoked by a user?

**Description**

Resize a virtual console, clipping according to the actual constraints. If
the caller passes a tty structure then update the termios winsize
information and perform any necessary signal handling.

Locking: Caller must hold the console semaphore. Takes the termios rwsem and
ctrl.lock of the tty IFF a tty is passed.

int vt_resize(struct [tty_struct](tty_struct.md#c.tty_struct "tty_struct") \*tty, struct winsize \*ws)
:   resize a VT

**Parameters**

`struct tty_struct *tty`
:   tty to resize

`struct winsize *ws`
:   winsize attributes

**Description**

Resize a virtual terminal. This is called by the tty layer as we register
our own handler for resizing. The mutual helper does all the actual work.

Locking: Takes the console sem and the called methods then take the tty
termios_rwsem and the tty ctrl.lock in that order.

:   Combine UTF-8 into Unicode in `vc_data.vc_utf_char`

**Parameters**

`struct vc_data *vc`
:   virtual console

`int c`
:   UTF-8 byte to translate

`bool *rescan`
:   set to true iff **c** wasn’t consumed here and needs to be re-processed

**Description**

- `vc_data.vc_utf_char` is the being-constructed Unicode code point.
- `vc_data.vc_utf_count` is the number of continuation bytes still expected to
  arrive.
- `vc_data.vc_npar` is the number of continuation bytes arrived so far.

**Return**

- `-1` - Input OK so far, **c** consumed, further bytes expected.
- `0xFFFD` - Possibility 1: input invalid, **c** may have been consumed (see
  :   desc. of **rescan**). Possibility 2: input OK, **c** consumed,
      `U+FFFD` is the resulting code point. `U+FFFD` is valid,
      `REPLACEMENT CHARACTER`.
- otherwise - Input OK, **c** consumed, resulting code point returned.

int vt_kmsg_redirect(int new)
:   sets/gets the kernel message console

**Parameters**

`int new`
:   the new virtual terminal number or -1 if the console should stay
    unchanged

**Description**

By default, the kernel messages are always printed on the current virtual
console. However, the user may modify that default with the
`TIOCL_SETKMSGREDIRECT` ioctl call.

This function sets the kernel message console to be **new**. It returns the old
virtual console number. The virtual terminal number `0` (both as parameter and
return value) means no redirection (i.e. always printed on the currently
active console).

The parameter -1 means that only the current console is returned, but the
value is not modified. You may use the macro `vt_get_kmsg_redirect()` in that
case to make the code more understandable.

When the kernel is compiled without `CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE`, this function ignores
the parameter and always returns `0`.
