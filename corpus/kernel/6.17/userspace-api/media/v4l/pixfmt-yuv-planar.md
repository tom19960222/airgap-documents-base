# 2.7.1.2. Planar YUV formats

Planar formats split luma and chroma data in separate memory regions. They
exist in two variants:

- Semi-planar formats use two planes. The first plane is the luma plane and
  stores the Y components. The second plane is the chroma plane and stores the
  Cb and Cr components interleaved.
- Fully planar formats use three planes to store the Y, Cb and Cr components
  separately.

Within a plane, components are stored in pixel order, which may be linear or
tiled. Padding may be supported at the end of the lines, and the line stride of
the chroma planes may be constrained by the line stride of the luma plane.

Some planar formats allow planes to be placed in independent memory locations.
They are identified by an ‘M’ suffix in their name (such as in
`V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M`). Those formats are intended to be used only in drivers
and applications that support the multi-planar API, described in
[Single- and multi-planar APIs](planar-apis.md#planar-apis). Unless explicitly documented as supporting non-contiguous
planes, formats require the planes to follow each other immediately in memory.

## 2.7.1.2.1. Semi-Planar YUV Formats

These formats are commonly referred to as NV formats (NV12, NV16, ...). They
use two planes, and store the luma components in the first plane and the chroma
components in the second plane. The Cb and Cr components are interleaved in the
chroma plane, with Cb and Cr always stored in pairs. The chroma order is
exposed as different formats.

For memory contiguous formats, the number of padding pixels at the end of the
chroma lines is identical to the padding of the luma lines. Without horizontal
subsampling, the chroma line stride (in bytes) is thus equal to twice the luma
line stride. With horizontal subsampling by 2, the chroma line stride is equal
to the luma line stride. Vertical subsampling doesn’t affect the line stride.

For non-contiguous formats, no constraints are enforced by the format on the
relationship between the luma and chroma line padding and stride.

All components are stored with the same number of bits per component.

### 2.7.1.2.1.3. Tiled NV12

Semi-planar YUV 4:2:0 formats, using macroblock tiling. The chroma plane is
subsampled by 2 in each direction. Chroma lines contain half the number of
pixels and the same number of bytes as luma lines, and the chroma plane
contains half the number of lines of the luma plane. Each tile follows the
previous one linearly in memory (from left to right, top to bottom).

`V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12MT_16X16` is similar to `V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M` but stores
pixels in 2D 16x16 tiles, and stores tiles linearly in memory.
The line stride and image height must be aligned to a multiple of 16.
The layouts of the luma and chroma planes are identical.

`V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12MT` is similar to `V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M` but stores
pixels in 2D 64x32 tiles, and stores 2x2 groups of tiles in
Z-order in memory, alternating Z and mirrored Z shapes horizontally.
The line stride must be a multiple of 128 pixels to ensure an
integer number of Z shapes. The image height must be a multiple of 32 pixels.
If the vertical resolution is an odd number of tiles, the last row of
tiles is stored in linear order. The layouts of the luma and chroma
planes are identical.

`V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12_4L4` stores pixels in 4x4 tiles, and stores
tiles linearly in memory. The line stride and image height must be
aligned to a multiple of 4. The layouts of the luma and chroma planes are
identical.

`V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12_16L16` stores pixels in 16x16 tiles, and stores
tiles linearly in memory. The line stride and image height must be
aligned to a multiple of 16. The layouts of the luma and chroma planes are
identical.

`V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12_32L32` stores pixels in 32x32 tiles, and stores
tiles linearly in memory. The line stride and image height must be
aligned to a multiple of 32. The layouts of the luma and chroma planes are
identical.

`V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M_8L128` is similar to `V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M` but stores
pixels in 2D 8x128 tiles, and stores tiles linearly in memory.
The image height must be aligned to a multiple of 128.
The layouts of the luma and chroma planes are identical.

`V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12_8L128` is similar to `V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M_8L128` but stores
two planes in one memory.

`V4L2_PIX_FMT_MM21` store luma pixel in 16x32 tiles, and chroma pixels
in 16x16 tiles. The line stride must be aligned to a multiple of 16 and the
image height must be aligned to a multiple of 32. The number of luma and chroma
tiles are identical, even though the tile size differ. The image is formed of
two non-contiguous planes.

### 2.7.1.2.1.4. Tiled NV15

`V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV15_4L4` Semi-planar 10-bit YUV 4:2:0 formats, using 4x4 tiling.
All components are packed without any padding between each other.
As a side-effect, each group of 4 components are stored over 5 bytes
(YYYY or UVUV = 4 \* 10 bits = 40 bits = 5 bytes).

`V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M_10BE_8L128` is similar to `V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M` but stores
10 bits pixels in 2D 8x128 tiles, and stores tiles linearly in memory.
the data is arranged in big endian order.
The image height must be aligned to a multiple of 128.
The layouts of the luma and chroma planes are identical.
Note the tile size is 8bytes multiplied by 128 bytes,
it means that the low bits and high bits of one pixel may be in different tiles.
The 10 bit pixels are packed, so 5 bytes contain 4 10-bit pixels layout like
this (for luma):
byte 0: Y0(bits 9-2)
byte 1: Y0(bits 1-0) Y1(bits 9-4)
byte 2: Y1(bits 3-0) Y2(bits 9-6)
byte 3: Y2(bits 5-0) Y3(bits 9-8)
byte 4: Y3(bits 7-0)

`V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12_10BE_8L128` is similar to `V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M_10BE_8L128` but stores
two planes in one memory.

`V4L2_PIX_FMT_MT2110T` is one of Mediatek packed 10bit YUV 4:2:0 formats.
It is fully packed 10bit 4:2:0 format like NV15 (15 bits per pixel), except
that the lower two bits data is stored in separate partitions. The format is
composed of 16x32 luma tiles, and 16x16 chroma tiles. Each tiles is 640 bytes
long, divided into 8 partitions of 80 bytes. The first 16 bytes of the
partition represent the 2 least significant bits of pixel data. The remaining
64 bytes represent the 8 most significant bits of pixel data.

![mt2110t.svg](../../../_images/mt2110t.svg)

Layout of MT2110T Chroma Tile

Filtering out the upper part of each partitions results in a valid
`V4L2_PIX_FMT_MM21` frame. A partition is a sub-tile of size 16 x 4. The
lower two bits is said to be tiled since each bytes contains the lower two
bits of the column of for pixel matching the same index. The chroma tiles
only have 4 partitions.

| Bits 7:6 | Y’3:0 | Y’3:1 | . . . | Y’3:15 |

`V4L2_PIX_FMT_MT2110R` is identical to `V4L2_PIX_FMT_MT2110T` except that
the least significant two bits layout is in raster order. This means the first byte
contains 4 pixels of the first row, with 4 bytes per line.

## 2.7.1.2.2. Fully Planar YUV Formats

These formats store the Y, Cb and Cr components in three separate planes. The
luma plane comes first, and the order of the two chroma planes varies between
formats. The two chroma planes always use the same subsampling.

For memory contiguous formats, the number of padding pixels at the end of the
chroma lines is identical to the padding of the luma lines. The chroma line
stride (in bytes) is thus equal to the luma line stride divided by the
horizontal subsampling factor. Vertical subsampling doesn’t affect the line
stride.

For non-contiguous formats, no constraints are enforced by the format on the
relationship between the luma and chroma line padding and stride.

All components are stored with the same number of bits per component.

`V4L2_PIX_FMT_P010_4L4` stores pixels in 4x4 tiles, and stores tiles linearly
in memory. The line stride must be aligned to multiple of 8 and image height to
a multiple of 4. The layouts of the luma and chroma planes are identical.
