# 6.2.3.2. DVB Audio Device

> **Attention:**
>
> Do **not** use in new drivers!
> See: [General Notes](legacy_dvb_decoder_api.md#legacy-dvb-decoder-notes)

The DVB audio device controls the MPEG2 audio decoder of the DVB
hardware. It can be accessed through `/dev/dvb/adapter?/audio?`. Data
types and ioctl definitions can be accessed by including
`linux/dvb/audio.h` in your application.

Please note that most DVB cards don’t have their own MPEG decoder, which
results in the omission of the audio and video device.

These ioctls were also used by V4L2 to control MPEG decoders implemented
in V4L2. The use of these ioctls for that purpose has been made obsolete
and proper V4L2 ioctls or controls have been created to replace that
functionality. Use [V4L2 ioctls](../v4l/audio.md#audio) for new drivers!

### 6.2.3.2.2.15. AUDIO_SET_STREAMTYPE

#### 6.2.3.2.2.15.1. Synopsis

AUDIO_SET_STREAMTYPE

```c
int  ioctl(fd, int request = AUDIO_SET_STREAMTYPE, int type)
```

#### 6.2.3.2.2.15.2. Arguments

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int fd` | File descriptor returned by a previous call to [open()](legacy_dvb_audio.md#open). | |
| `int request` | Equals `AUDIO_SET_STREAMTYPE` for this command. | |
| `int type` | Stream type. | |

#### 6.2.3.2.2.15.3. Description

> **Attention:**
>
> Do **not** use in new drivers!
> See: [General Notes](legacy_dvb_decoder_api.md#legacy-dvb-decoder-notes)

This ioctl tells the driver which kind of audio stream to expect. This
is useful if the stream offers several audio sub-streams like LPCM and
AC3.

Stream types defined in ITU-T H.222.0 | ISO/IEC 13818-1 are used.

#### 6.2.3.2.2.15.4. Return Value

On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the `errno` variable is set
appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
[Generic Error Codes](../gen-errors.md#id1) chapter.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `EINVAL` | Type is not a valid or supported stream type. |

### 6.2.3.2.2.16. AUDIO_BILINGUAL_CHANNEL_SELECT

#### 6.2.3.2.2.16.1. Synopsis

AUDIO_BILINGUAL_CHANNEL_SELECT

```c
int ioctl(int fd, int request = AUDIO_BILINGUAL_CHANNEL_SELECT,
audio_channel_select_t)
```

#### 6.2.3.2.2.16.2. Arguments

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int fd` | File descriptor returned by a previous call to [open()](legacy_dvb_audio.md#open). | |
| `int request` | Equals `AUDIO_BILINGUAL_CHANNEL_SELECT` for this command. | |
| `audio_channel_select_t ch` | Select the output format of the audio (mono left/right, stereo). | |

#### 6.2.3.2.2.16.3. Description

> **Attention:**
>
> Do **not** use in new drivers!
> See: [General Notes](legacy_dvb_decoder_api.md#legacy-dvb-decoder-notes)

This ioctl has been replaced by the V4L2
`V4L2_CID_MPEG_AUDIO_DEC_MULTILINGUAL_PLAYBACK` control
for MPEG decoders controlled through V4L2.

This ioctl call asks the Audio Device to select the requested channel
for bilingual streams if possible.

#### 6.2.3.2.2.16.4. Return Value

On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the `errno` variable is set
appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
[Generic Error Codes](../gen-errors.md#id1) chapter.

### 6.2.3.2.2.17. open()

#### 6.2.3.2.2.17.1. Synopsis

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
```

int open(const char \*deviceName, int flags)

#### 6.2.3.2.2.17.2. Arguments

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `const char *deviceName` | Name of specific audio device. | |
| `int flags` | A bit-wise OR of the following flags: | |
| `O_RDONLY` | read-only access |
| `O_RDWR` | read/write access |
| `O_NONBLOCK` | Open in non-blocking mode  (blocking mode is the default) |

#### 6.2.3.2.2.17.3. Description

This system call opens a named audio device (e.g.
`/dev/dvb/adapter0/audio0`) for subsequent use. When an [`open()`](legacy_dvb_audio.md#c.dtv.legacy.audio.open "dtv.legacy.audio.open") call has
succeeded, the device will be ready for use. The significance of
blocking or non-blocking mode is described in the documentation for
functions where there is a difference. It does not affect the semantics
of the [`open()`](legacy_dvb_audio.md#c.dtv.legacy.audio.open "dtv.legacy.audio.open") call itself. A device opened in blocking mode can later be
put into non-blocking mode (and vice versa) using the F_SETFL command
of the fcntl system call. This is a standard system call, documented in
the Linux manual page for fcntl. Only one user can open the Audio Device
in O_RDWR mode. All other attempts to open the device in this mode will
fail, and an error code will be returned. If the Audio Device is opened
in O_RDONLY mode, the only ioctl call that can be used is
[AUDIO_GET_STATUS](legacy_dvb_audio.md#audio-get-status). All other call will return with an error code.

#### 6.2.3.2.2.17.4. Return Value

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `ENODEV` | Device driver not loaded/available. |
| `EBUSY` | Device or resource busy. |
| `EINVAL` | Invalid argument. |

---

### 6.2.3.2.2.18. close()

#### 6.2.3.2.2.18.1. Synopsis

int close(int fd)

#### 6.2.3.2.2.18.2. Arguments

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int fd` | File descriptor returned by a previous call to [open()](legacy_dvb_audio.md#open). | |

#### 6.2.3.2.2.18.3. Description

This system call closes a previously opened audio device.

#### 6.2.3.2.2.18.4. Return Value

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `EBADF` | Fd is not a valid open file descriptor. |

---

### 6.2.3.2.2.19. write()

#### 6.2.3.2.2.19.1. Synopsis

```c
size_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count)
```

#### 6.2.3.2.2.19.2. Arguments

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int fd` | File descriptor returned by a previous call to [open()](legacy_dvb_audio.md#open). | |
| `void *buf` | Pointer to the buffer containing the PES data. | |
| `size_t count` | Size of buf. | |

#### 6.2.3.2.2.19.3. Description

This system call can only be used if `AUDIO_SOURCE_MEMORY` is selected
in the ioctl call [AUDIO_SELECT_SOURCE](legacy_dvb_audio.md#audio-select-source). The data provided shall be in
PES format. If `O_NONBLOCK` is not specified the function will block
until buffer space is available. The amount of data to be transferred is
implied by count.

#### 6.2.3.2.2.19.4. Return Value

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EPERM` | Mode `AUDIO_SOURCE_MEMORY` not selected. | |
| `ENOMEM` | Attempted to write more data than the internal buffer can hold. | |
| `EBADF` | Fd is not a valid open file descriptor. | |
