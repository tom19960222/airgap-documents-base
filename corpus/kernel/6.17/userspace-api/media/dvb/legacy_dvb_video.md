# 6.2.3.1. DVB Video Device

> **Attention:**
>
> Do **not** use in new drivers!
> See: [General Notes](legacy_dvb_decoder_api.md#legacy-dvb-decoder-notes)

The DVB video device controls the MPEG2 video decoder of the DVB
hardware. It can be accessed through `/dev/dvb/adapter0/video0`. Data
types and ioctl definitions can be accessed by including
`linux/dvb/video.h` in your application.

Note that the DVB video device only controls decoding of the MPEG video
stream, not its presentation on the TV or computer screen. On PCs this
is typically handled by an associated video4linux device, e.g.
`/dev/video`, which allows scaling and defining output windows.

Most DVB cards don’t have their own MPEG decoder, which results in the
omission of the audio and video device as well as the video4linux
device.

These ioctls were also used by V4L2 to control MPEG decoders implemented
in V4L2. The use of these ioctls for that purpose has been made obsolete
and proper V4L2 ioctls or controls have been created to replace that
functionality. Use [V4L2 ioctls](../v4l/video.md#video) for new drivers!

## 6.2.3.1.1. Video Data Types

### 6.2.3.1.1.1. video_format_t

#### 6.2.3.1.1.1.1. Synopsis

#### 6.2.3.1.1.1.3. Description

The `video_format_t` data type
is used in the [VIDEO_SET_FORMAT](legacy_dvb_video.md#video-set-format) function to tell the driver which
aspect ratio the output hardware (e.g. TV) has. It is also used in the
data structures [video_status](legacy_dvb_video.md#video-status) returned by [VIDEO_GET_STATUS](legacy_dvb_video.md#video-get-status)
and [video_event](legacy_dvb_video.md#video-event) returned by [VIDEO_GET_EVENT](legacy_dvb_video.md#video-get-event) which report
about the display format of the current video stream.

and can take the following values, depending on whether we are replaying
from an internal (demuxer) or external (user write) source.
VIDEO_SOURCE_DEMUX selects the demultiplexer (fed either by the
frontend or the DVR device) as the source of the video stream. If
VIDEO_SOURCE_MEMORY is selected the stream comes from the application
through the [write()](legacy_dvb_video.md#write) system call.

### 6.2.3.1.2.8. VIDEO_GET_EVENT

#### 6.2.3.1.2.8.1. Synopsis

VIDEO_GET_EVENT

```c
int ioctl(fd, int request = VIDEO_GET_EVENT,
struct video_event *ev)
```

#### 6.2.3.1.2.8.2. Arguments

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int fd` | File descriptor returned by a previous call to [open()](legacy_dvb_video.md#open). | |
| `int request` | Equals `VIDEO_GET_EVENT` for this command. | |
| `struct` [video_event](legacy_dvb_video.md#video-event) `*ev` | Points to the location where the event, if any, is to be stored. | |

#### 6.2.3.1.2.8.3. Description

> **Attention:**
>
> Do **not** use in new drivers!
> See: [General Notes](legacy_dvb_decoder_api.md#legacy-dvb-decoder-notes)

This ioctl is for DVB devices only. To get events from a V4L2 decoder
use the V4L2 [ioctl VIDIOC_DQEVENT](../v4l/vidioc-dqevent.md#vidioc-dqevent) ioctl instead.

This ioctl call returns an event of type [video_event](legacy_dvb_video.md#video-event) if available. A
certain number of the latest events will be cued and returned in order of
occurrence. Older events may be discarded if not fetched in time. If
an event is not available, the behavior depends on whether the device is
in blocking or non-blocking mode. In the latter case, the call fails
immediately with errno set to `EWOULDBLOCK`. In the former case, the
call blocks until an event becomes available. The standard Linux `poll()`
and/or `select()` system calls can be used with the device file descriptor
to watch for new events. For `select()`, the file descriptor should be
included in the exceptfds argument, and for `poll()`, POLLPRI should be
specified as the wake-up condition. Read-only permissions are sufficient
for this ioctl call.

#### 6.2.3.1.2.8.4. Return Value

On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the `errno` variable is set
appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
[Generic Error Codes](../gen-errors.md#id1) chapter.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EWOULDBLOCK` | There is no event pending, and the device is in non-blocking mode. | |
| `EOVERFLOW` | Overflow in event queue - one or more events were lost. | |

| `O_RDWR` | read/write access |
| `O_NONBLOCK` | Open in non-blocking mode  (blocking mode is the default) |

#### 6.2.3.1.2.22.3. Description

This system call opens a named video device (e.g.
/dev/dvb/adapter?/video?) for subsequent use.

When an [`open()`](legacy_dvb_video.md#c.dtv.legacy.video.open "dtv.legacy.video.open") call has succeeded, the device will be ready for use. The
significance of blocking or non-blocking mode is described in the
documentation for functions where there is a difference. It does not
affect the semantics of the [`open()`](legacy_dvb_video.md#c.dtv.legacy.video.open "dtv.legacy.video.open") call itself. A device opened in
blocking mode can later be put into non-blocking mode (and vice versa)
using the F_SETFL command of the fcntl system call. This is a standard
system call, documented in the Linux manual page for fcntl. Only one
user can open the Video Device in O_RDWR mode. All other attempts to
open the device in this mode will fail, and an error-code will be
returned. If the Video Device is opened in O_RDONLY mode, the only
ioctl call that can be used is [VIDEO_GET_STATUS](legacy_dvb_video.md#video-get-status). All other call will
return an error code.

#### 6.2.3.1.2.22.4. Return Value
