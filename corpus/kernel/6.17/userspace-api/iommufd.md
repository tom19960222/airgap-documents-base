## Overview

IOMMUFD is the user API to control the IOMMU subsystem as it relates to managing
IO page tables from userspace using file descriptors. It intends to be general
and consumable by any driver that wants to expose DMA to userspace. These
drivers are eventually expected to deprecate any internal IOMMU logic
they may already/historically implement (e.g. vfio_iommu_type1.c).

At minimum iommufd provides universal support of managing I/O address spaces and
I/O page tables for all IOMMUs, with room in the design to add non-generic
features to cater to specific hardware functionality.

In this context the capital letter (IOMMUFD) refers to the subsystem while the
small letter (iommufd) refers to the file descriptors created via /dev/iommu for
use by userspace.

## Key Concepts

### User Visible Objects

Following IOMMUFD objects are exposed to userspace:

- IOMMUFD_OBJ_IOAS, representing an I/O address space (IOAS), allowing map/unmap
  of user space memory into ranges of I/O Virtual Address (IOVA).

  The IOAS is a functional replacement for the VFIO container, and like the VFIO
  container it copies an IOVA map to a list of iommu_domains held within it.
- IOMMUFD_OBJ_DEVICE, representing a device that is bound to iommufd by an
  external driver.
- IOMMUFD_OBJ_HWPT_PAGING, representing an actual hardware I/O page table
  (i.e. a single `struct iommu_domain`) managed by the iommu driver. “PAGING”
  primarily indicates this type of HWPT should be linked to an IOAS. It also
  indicates that it is backed by an iommu_domain with __IOMMU_DOMAIN_PAGING
  feature flag. This can be either an UNMANAGED stage-1 domain for a device
  running in the user space, or a nesting parent stage-2 domain for mappings
  from guest-level physical addresses to host-level physical addresses.

  The IOAS has a list of HWPT_PAGINGs that share the same IOVA mapping and
  it will synchronize its mapping with each member HWPT_PAGING.
- IOMMUFD_OBJ_HWPT_NESTED, representing an actual hardware I/O page table
  (i.e. a single `struct iommu_domain`) managed by user space (e.g. guest OS).
  “NESTED” indicates that this type of HWPT should be linked to an HWPT_PAGING.
  It also indicates that it is backed by an iommu_domain that has a type of
  IOMMU_DOMAIN_NESTED. This must be a stage-1 domain for a device running in
  the user space (e.g. in a guest VM enabling the IOMMU nested translation
  feature.) As such, it must be created with a given nesting parent stage-2
  domain to associate to. This nested stage-1 page table managed by the user
  space usually has mappings from guest-level I/O virtual addresses to guest-
  level physical addresses.
- IOMMUFD_FAULT, representing a software queue for an HWPT reporting IO page
  faults using the IOMMU HW’s PRI (Page Request Interface). This queue object
  provides user space an FD to poll the page fault events and also to respond
  to those events. A FAULT object must be created first to get a fault_id that
  could be then used to allocate a fault-enabled HWPT via the IOMMU_HWPT_ALLOC
  command by setting the IOMMU_HWPT_FAULT_ID_VALID bit in its flags field.
- IOMMUFD_OBJ_VIOMMU, representing a slice of the physical IOMMU instance,
  passed to or shared with a VM. It may be some HW-accelerated virtualization
  features and some SW resources used by the VM. For examples:

  - Security namespace for guest owned ID, e.g. guest-controlled cache tags
  - Non-device-affiliated event reporting, e.g. invalidation queue errors
  - Access to a shareable nesting parent pagetable across physical IOMMUs
  - Virtualization of various platforms IDs, e.g. RIDs and others
  - Delivery of paravirtualized invalidation
  - Direct assigned invalidation queues
  - Direct assigned interrupts

  Such a vIOMMU object generally has the access to a nesting parent pagetable
  to support some HW-accelerated virtualization features. So, a vIOMMU object
  must be created given a nesting parent HWPT_PAGING object, and then it would
  encapsulate that HWPT_PAGING object. Therefore, a vIOMMU object can be used
  to allocate an HWPT_NESTED object in place of the encapsulated HWPT_PAGING.

  > **Note:**
  >
  > The name “vIOMMU” isn’t necessarily identical to a virtualized IOMMU in a
  > VM. A VM can have one giant virtualized IOMMU running on a machine having
  > multiple physical IOMMUs, in which case the VMM will dispatch the requests
  > or configurations from this single virtualized IOMMU instance to multiple
  > vIOMMU objects created for individual slices of different physical IOMMUs.
  > In other words, a vIOMMU object is always a representation of one physical
  > IOMMU, not necessarily of a virtualized IOMMU. For VMMs that want the full
  > virtualization features from physical IOMMUs, it is suggested to build the
  > same number of virtualized IOMMUs as the number of physical IOMMUs, so the
  > passed-through devices would be connected to their own virtualized IOMMUs
  > backed by corresponding vIOMMU objects, in which case a guest OS would do
  > the “dispatch” naturally instead of VMM trappings.
- IOMMUFD_OBJ_VDEVICE, representing a virtual device for an IOMMUFD_OBJ_DEVICE
  against an IOMMUFD_OBJ_VIOMMU. This virtual device holds the device’s virtual
  information or attributes (related to the vIOMMU) in a VM. An immediate vDATA
  example can be the virtual ID of the device on a vIOMMU, which is a unique ID
  that VMM assigns to the device for a translation channel/port of the vIOMMU,
  e.g. vSID of ARM SMMUv3, vDeviceID of AMD IOMMU, and vRID of Intel VT-d to a
  Context Table. Potential use cases of some advanced security information can
  be forwarded via this object too, such as security level or realm information
  in a Confidential Compute Architecture. A VMM should create a vDEVICE object
  to forward all the device information in a VM, when it connects a device to a
  vIOMMU, which is a separate ioctl call from attaching the same device to an
  HWPT_PAGING that the vIOMMU holds.
- IOMMUFD_OBJ_VEVENTQ, representing a software queue for a vIOMMU to report its
  events such as translation faults occurred to a nested stage-1 (excluding I/O
  page faults that should go through IOMMUFD_OBJ_FAULT) and HW-specific events.
  This queue object provides user space an FD to poll/read the vIOMMU events. A
  vIOMMU object must be created first to get its viommu_id, which could be then
  used to allocate a vEVENTQ. Each vIOMMU can support multiple types of vEVENTS,
  but is confined to one vEVENTQ per vEVENTQ type.
- IOMMUFD_OBJ_HW_QUEUE, representing a hardware accelerated queue, as a subset
  of IOMMU’s virtualization features, for the IOMMU HW to directly read or write
  the virtual queue memory owned by a guest OS. This HW-acceleration feature can
  allow VM to work with the IOMMU HW directly without a VM Exit, so as to reduce
  overhead from the hypercalls. Along with the HW QUEUE object, iommufd provides
  user space an mmap interface for VMM to mmap a physical MMIO region from the
  host physical address space to the guest physical address space, allowing the
  guest OS to directly control the allocated HW QUEUE. Thus, when allocating a
  HW QUEUE, the VMM must request a pair of mmap info (offset/length) and pass in
  exactly to an mmap syscall via its offset and length arguments.

All user-visible objects are destroyed via the IOMMU_DESTROY uAPI.

The diagrams below show relationships between user-visible objects and kernel
datastructures (external to iommufd), with numbers referred to operations
creating the objects and links:

1. IOMMUFD_OBJ_IOAS is created via the IOMMU_IOAS_ALLOC uAPI. An iommufd can
   hold multiple IOAS objects. IOAS is the most generic object and does not
   expose interfaces that are specific to single IOMMU drivers. All operations
   on the IOAS must operate equally on each of the iommu_domains inside of it.
2. IOMMUFD_OBJ_DEVICE is created when an external driver calls the IOMMUFD kAPI
   to bind a device to an iommufd. The driver is expected to implement a set of
   ioctls to allow userspace to initiate the binding operation. Successful
   completion of this operation establishes the desired DMA ownership over the
   device. The driver must also set the driver_managed_dma flag and must not
   touch the device until this operation succeeds.
3. IOMMUFD_OBJ_HWPT_PAGING can be created in two ways:

   - IOMMUFD_OBJ_HWPT_PAGING is automatically created when an external driver
     calls the IOMMUFD kAPI to attach a bound device to an IOAS. Similarly the
     external driver uAPI allows userspace to initiate the attaching operation.
     If a compatible member HWPT_PAGING object exists in the IOAS’s HWPT_PAGING
     list, then it will be reused. Otherwise a new HWPT_PAGING that represents
     an iommu_domain to userspace will be created, and then added to the list.
     Successful completion of this operation sets up the linkages among IOAS,
     device and iommu_domain. Once this completes the device could do DMA.
   - IOMMUFD_OBJ_HWPT_PAGING can be manually created via the IOMMU_HWPT_ALLOC
     uAPI, provided an ioas_id via @pt_id to associate the new HWPT_PAGING to
     the corresponding IOAS object. The benefit of this manual allocation is to
     allow allocation flags (defined in [`enum iommufd_hwpt_alloc_flags`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_hwpt_alloc_flags "iommufd_hwpt_alloc_flags")), e.g. it
     allocates a nesting parent HWPT_PAGING if the IOMMU_HWPT_ALLOC_NEST_PARENT
     flag is set.
4. IOMMUFD_OBJ_HWPT_NESTED can be only manually created via the IOMMU_HWPT_ALLOC
   uAPI, provided an hwpt_id or a viommu_id of a vIOMMU object encapsulating a
   nesting parent HWPT_PAGING via @pt_id to associate the new HWPT_NESTED object
   to the corresponding HWPT_PAGING object. The associating HWPT_PAGING object
   must be a nesting parent manually allocated via the same uAPI previously with
   an IOMMU_HWPT_ALLOC_NEST_PARENT flag, otherwise the allocation will fail. The
   allocation will be further validated by the IOMMU driver to ensure that the
   nesting parent domain and the nested domain being allocated are compatible.
   Successful completion of this operation sets up linkages among IOAS, device,
   and iommu_domains. Once this completes the device could do DMA via a 2-stage
   translation, a.k.a nested translation. Note that multiple HWPT_NESTED objects
   can be allocated by (and then associated to) the same nesting parent.

   > **Note:**
   >
   > Either a manual IOMMUFD_OBJ_HWPT_PAGING or an IOMMUFD_OBJ_HWPT_NESTED is
   > created via the same IOMMU_HWPT_ALLOC uAPI. The difference is at the type
   > of the object passed in via the @pt_id field of `struct iommufd_hwpt_alloc`.
5. IOMMUFD_OBJ_VIOMMU can be only manually created via the IOMMU_VIOMMU_ALLOC
   uAPI, provided a dev_id (for the device’s physical IOMMU to back the vIOMMU)
   and an hwpt_id (to associate the vIOMMU to a nesting parent HWPT_PAGING). The
   iommufd core will link the vIOMMU object to the `struct iommu_device` that the
   [`struct device`](../driver-api/infrastructure.md#c.device "device") is behind. And an IOMMU driver can implement a viommu_alloc op
   to allocate its own vIOMMU data structure embedding the core-level structure
   iommufd_viommu and some driver-specific data. If necessary, the driver can
   also configure its HW virtualization feature for that vIOMMU (and thus for
   the VM). Successful completion of this operation sets up the linkages between
   the vIOMMU object and the HWPT_PAGING, then this vIOMMU object can be used
   as a nesting parent object to allocate an HWPT_NESTED object described above.
6. IOMMUFD_OBJ_VDEVICE can be only manually created via the IOMMU_VDEVICE_ALLOC
   uAPI, provided a viommu_id for an iommufd_viommu object and a dev_id for an
   iommufd_device object. The vDEVICE object will be the binding between these
   two parent objects. Another @virt_id will be also set via the uAPI providing
   the iommufd core an index to store the vDEVICE object to a vDEVICE array per
   vIOMMU. If necessary, the IOMMU driver may choose to implement a vdevce_alloc
   op to init its HW for virtualization feature related to a vDEVICE. Successful
   completion of this operation sets up the linkages between vIOMMU and device.

A device can only bind to an iommufd due to DMA ownership claim and attach to at
most one IOAS object (no support of PASID yet).

### Kernel Datastructure

User visible objects are backed by following datastructures:

- iommufd_ioas for IOMMUFD_OBJ_IOAS.
- iommufd_device for IOMMUFD_OBJ_DEVICE.
- iommufd_hwpt_paging for IOMMUFD_OBJ_HWPT_PAGING.
- iommufd_hwpt_nested for IOMMUFD_OBJ_HWPT_NESTED.
- iommufd_fault for IOMMUFD_OBJ_FAULT.
- iommufd_viommu for IOMMUFD_OBJ_VIOMMU.
- iommufd_vdevice for IOMMUFD_OBJ_VDEVICE.
- iommufd_veventq for IOMMUFD_OBJ_VEVENTQ.
- iommufd_hw_queue for IOMMUFD_OBJ_HW_QUEUE.

Several terminologies when looking at these datastructures:

- Automatic domain - refers to an iommu domain created automatically when
  attaching a device to an IOAS object. This is compatible to the semantics of
  VFIO type1.
- Manual domain - refers to an iommu domain designated by the user as the
  target pagetable to be attached to by a device. Though currently there are
  no uAPIs to directly create such domain, the datastructure and algorithms
  are ready for handling that use case.
- In-kernel user - refers to something like a VFIO mdev that is using the
  IOMMUFD access interface to access the IOAS. This starts by creating an
  iommufd_access object that is similar to the domain binding a physical device
  would do. The access object will then allow converting IOVA ranges into `struct
  page` \* lists, or doing direct read/write to an IOVA.

iommufd_ioas serves as the metadata datastructure to manage how IOVA ranges are
mapped to memory pages, composed of:

- `struct io_pagetable` holding the IOVA map
- `struct iopt_area`’s representing populated portions of IOVA
- `struct iopt_pages` representing the storage of PFNs
- `struct iommu_domain` representing the IO page table in the IOMMU
- `struct iopt_pages_access` representing in-kernel users of PFNs
- [`struct xarray`](../core-api/xarray.md#c.xarray "xarray") pinned_pfns holding a list of pages pinned by in-kernel users

Each iopt_pages represents a logical linear array of full PFNs. The PFNs are
ultimately derived from userspace VAs via an mm_struct. Once they have been
pinned the PFNs are stored in IOPTEs of an iommu_domain or inside the pinned_pfns
xarray if they have been pinned through an iommufd_access.

PFN have to be copied between all combinations of storage locations, depending
on what domains are present and what kinds of in-kernel “software access” users
exist. The mechanism ensures that a page is pinned only once.

An io_pagetable is composed of iopt_areas pointing at iopt_pages, along with a
list of iommu_domains that mirror the IOVA to PFN map.

Multiple io_pagetable-s, through their iopt_area-s, can share a single
iopt_pages which avoids multi-pinning and double accounting of page
consumption.

iommufd_ioas is shareable between subsystems, e.g. VFIO and VDPA, as long as
devices managed by different subsystems are bound to a same iommufd.

## IOMMUFD User API

**General ioctl format**

The ioctl interface follows a general format to allow for extensibility. Each
ioctl is passed in a structure pointer as the argument providing the size of
the structure in the first u32. The kernel checks that any structure space
beyond what it understands is 0. This allows userspace to use the backward
compatible portion while consistently using the newer, larger, structures.

ioctls use a standard meaning for common errnos:

> - ENOTTY: The IOCTL number itself is not supported at all
> - E2BIG: The IOCTL number is supported, but the provided structure has
>   non-zero in a part the kernel does not understand.
> - EOPNOTSUPP: The IOCTL number is supported, and the structure is
>   understood, however a known field has a value the kernel does not
>   understand or support.
> - EINVAL: Everything about the IOCTL was understood, but a field is not
>   correct.
> - ENOENT: An ID or IOVA provided does not exist.
> - ENOMEM: Out of memory.
> - EOVERFLOW: Mathematics overflowed.

As well as additional errnos, within specific ioctls.

can change during the lifetime of the IOAS. A fresh empty IOAS will have a
full range, and each attached device will narrow the ranges based on that
device’s HW restrictions. Detaching a device can widen the ranges. Userspace
should query ranges after every attach/detach to know what IOVAs are valid
for mapping.

On input num_iovas is the length of the allowed_iovas array. On output it is
the total number of iovas filled in. The ioctl will return -EMSGSIZE and set
num_iovas to the required value if num_iovas is too small. In this case the
caller should allocate a larger output array and re-issue the ioctl.

out_iova_alignment returns the minimum IOVA alignment that can be given
to IOMMU_IOAS_MAP/COPY. IOVA’s must satisfy:

```
starting_iova % out_iova_alignment == 0
(starting_iova + length) % out_iova_alignment == 0
```

out_iova_alignment can be 1 indicating any IOVA is allowed. It cannot
be higher than the system PAGE_SIZE.

**Members**

`size`
:   sizeof([`struct iommu_ioas_allow_iovas`](iommufd.md#c.iommu_ioas_allow_iovas "iommu_ioas_allow_iovas"))

`ioas_id`
:   IOAS ID to allow IOVAs from

`num_iovas`
:   Input/Output total number of ranges in the IOAS

`__reserved`
:   Must be 0

`allowed_iovas`
:   Pointer to array of [`struct iommu_iova_range`](iommufd.md#c.iommu_iova_range "iommu_iova_range")

**Description**

Ensure a range of IOVAs are always available for allocation. If this call
succeeds then IOMMU_IOAS_IOVA_RANGES will never return a list of IOVA ranges
that are narrower than the ranges provided here. This call will fail if
IOMMU_IOAS_IOVA_RANGES is currently narrower than the given ranges.

When an IOAS is first created the IOVA_RANGES will be maximally sized, and as
devices are attached the IOVA will narrow based on the device restrictions.
When an allowed range is specified any narrowing will be refused, ie device
attachment can fail if the device requires limiting within the allowed range.

Automatic IOVA allocation is also impacted by this call. MAP will only
allocate within the allowed IOVAs if they are present.

This call replaces the entire allowed list with the given list.

`src_iova`
:   IOVA to start the copy

**Description**

Copy an already existing mapping from src_ioas_id and establish it in
dst_ioas_id. The src iova/length must exactly match a range used with
IOMMU_IOAS_MAP.

This may be used to efficiently clone a subset of an IOAS to another, or as a
kind of ‘cache’ to speed up mapping. Copy has an efficiency advantage over
establishing equivalent new mappings, as internal resources are shared, and
the kernel will pin the user memory only once.

**Description**

The VFIO compatibility support uses a single ioas because VFIO APIs do not
support the ID field. Set or Get the IOAS that VFIO compatibility will use.
When VFIO_GROUP_SET_CONTAINER is used on an iommufd it will get the
compatibility ioas, either by taking what is already set, or auto creating

**Description**

Explicitly allocate a hardware page table object. This is the same object
type that is returned by [`iommufd_device_attach()`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_device_attach "iommufd_device_attach") and represents the
underlying iommu driver’s iommu_domain kernel object.

A kernel-managed HWPT will be created with the mappings from the given
IOAS via the **pt_id**. The **data_type** for this allocation must be set to
IOMMU_HWPT_DATA_NONE. The HWPT can be allocated as a parent HWPT for a
nesting configuration by passing IOMMU_HWPT_ALLOC_NEST_PARENT via **flags**.

A user-managed nested HWPT will be created from a given vIOMMU (wrapping a
parent HWPT) or a parent HWPT via **pt_id**, in which the parent HWPT must be
allocated previously via the same ioctl from a given IOAS (**pt_id**). In this
case, the **data_type** must be set to a pre-defined type corresponding to an
I/O page table type supported by the underlying IOMMU hardware. The device
via **dev_id** and the vIOMMU via **pt_id** must be associated to the same IOMMU
instance.

If the **data_type** is set to IOMMU_HWPT_DATA_NONE, **data_len** and
**data_uptr** should be zero. Otherwise, both **data_len** and **data_uptr**
must be given.

**Description**

For the details of **idr**, **iidr** and **aidr**, please refer to the chapters
from 6.3.1 to 6.3.6 in the SMMUv3 Spec.

This reports the raw HW capability, and not all bits are meaningful to be
read by userspace. Only the following fields should be used:

idr[0]: ST_LEVEL, TERM_MODEL, STALL_MODEL, TTENDIAN , CD2L, ASID16, TTF
idr[1]: SIDSIZE, SSIDSIZE
idr[3]: BBML, RIL
idr[5]: VAX, GRAN64K, GRAN16K, GRAN4K

- S1P should be assumed to be true if a NESTED HWPT can be created
- VFIO/iommufd only support platforms with COHACC, it should be assumed to be
  true.
- ATS is a per-device property. If the VMM describes any devices as ATS
  capable in ACPI/DT it should set the corresponding idr.

This list may expand in future (eg E0PD, AIE, PBHA, D128, DS etc). It is
important that VMMs do not read bits outside the list to allow for
compatibility with future kernels. Several features in the SMMUv3
architecture are not currently supported by the kernel for nesting: HTTU,
BTM, MPAM and others.

    set, an input type carried via this **in_data_type** field will
    be valid, requesting for the info data to the given type. If
    IOMMU_HW_INFO_FLAG_INPUT_TYPE is unset, any input value will
    be seen as IOMMU_HW_INFO_TYPE_DEFAULT

`out_data_type`
:   Output the iommu hardware info type as defined in the [`enum
    iommu_hw_info_type`](iommufd.md#c.iommu_hw_info_type "iommu_hw_info_type").

`out_max_pasid_log2`
:   Output the width of PASIDs. 0 means no PASID support.
    PCI devices turn to out_capabilities to check if the
    specific capabilities is supported or not.

`__reserved`
:   Must be 0

`out_capabilities`
:   Output the generic iommu capability info type as defined
    in the `enum iommu_hw_capabilities`.

**Description**

Query an iommu type specific hardware information data from an iommu behind
a given device that has been bound to iommufd. This hardware info data will
be used to sync capabilities between the virtual iommu and the physical
iommu, e.g. a nested translation setup needs to check the hardware info, so
a guest stage-1 page table can be compatible with the physical iommu.

To capture an iommu type specific hardware information data, **data_uptr** and
its length **data_len** must be provided. Trailing bytes will be zeroed if the
user buffer is larger than the data that kernel has. Otherwise, kernel only
fills the buffer using the given length in **data_len**. If the ioctl succeeds,
**data_len** will be updated to the length that kernel actually supports,
**out_data_type** will be filled to decode the data filled in the buffer
pointed by **data_uptr**. Input **data_len** == zero is allowed.

This instance holds the device’s information (related to its vIOMMU) in a VM.
User should use IOMMU_DESTROY to destroy the virtual device before
destroying the physical device (by closing vfio_cdev fd). Otherwise the
virtual device would be forcibly destroyed on physical device destruction,
its vdevice_id would be permanently leaked (unremovable & unreusable) until

:   The sequence index of a vEVENT in the vEVENTQ, with a range of
    [0, INT_MAX] where the following index of INT_MAX is 0

**Description**

Each iommufd_vevent_header reports a sequence index of the following vEVENT:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| header0 {sequence=0} | data0 | header1 {sequence=1} | data1 | ... | dataN |

And this sequence index is expected to be monotonic to the sequence index of
the previous vEVENT. If two adjacent sequence indexes has a delta larger than
1, it means that delta - 1 number of vEVENTs has lost, e.g. two lost vEVENTs:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ... | header3 {sequence=3} | data3 | header6 {sequence=6} | data6 | ... |

If a vEVENT lost at the tail of the vEVENTQ and there is no following vEVENT
providing the next sequence index, an IOMMU_VEVENTQ_FLAG_LOST_EVENTS header
would be added to the tail, and no data would follow this header:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | header3 {sequence=3} | data3 | header4 {flags=LOST_EVENTS, sequence=4} |

:   ioctl(IOMMU_HW_QUEUE_ALLOC)

**Definition**:

```
struct iommu_hw_queue_alloc {
    __u32 size;
    __u32 flags;
    __u32 viommu_id;
    __u32 type;
    __u32 index;
    __u32 out_hw_queue_id;
    __aligned_u64 nesting_parent_iova;
    __aligned_u64 length;
};
```

**Members**

`size`
:   sizeof([`struct iommu_hw_queue_alloc`](iommufd.md#c.iommu_hw_queue_alloc "iommu_hw_queue_alloc"))

`flags`
:   Must be 0

`viommu_id`
:   Virtual IOMMU ID to associate the HW queue with

`type`
:   One of [`enum iommu_hw_queue_type`](iommufd.md#c.iommu_hw_queue_type "iommu_hw_queue_type")

`index`
:   The logical index to the HW queue per virtual IOMMU for a multi-queue
    model

`out_hw_queue_id`
:   The ID of the new HW queue

`nesting_parent_iova`
:   Base address of the queue memory in the guest physical
    address space

`length`
:   Length of the queue memory

**Description**

Allocate a HW queue object for a vIOMMU-specific HW-accelerated queue, which
allows HW to access a guest queue memory described using **nesting_parent_iova**
and **length**.

A vIOMMU can allocate multiple queues, but it must use a different **index** per
type to separate each allocation, e.g:

```
Type1 HW queue0, Type1 HW queue1, Type2 HW queue0, ...
```

## IOMMUFD Kernel API

The IOMMUFD kAPI is device-centric with group-related tricks managed behind the
scene. This allows the external drivers calling such kAPI to implement a simple
device-centric uAPI for connecting its device to an iommufd, instead of
explicitly imposing the group semantics in its uAPI as VFIO does.

struct iommufd_device \*iommufd_device_bind(struct iommufd_ctx \*ictx, struct [device](../driver-api/infrastructure.md#c.device "device") \*dev, u32 \*id)
:   Bind a physical device to an iommu fd

**Parameters**

`struct iommufd_ctx *ictx`
:   iommufd file descriptor

`struct device *dev`
:   Pointer to a physical device struct

`u32 *id`
:   Output ID number to return to userspace for this device

**Description**

A successful bind establishes an ownership over the device and returns
`struct iommufd_device` pointer, otherwise returns error pointer.

A driver using this API must set driver_managed_dma and must not touch
the device until this routine succeeds and establishes ownership.

Binding a PCI device places the entire RID under iommufd control.

The caller must undo this with [`iommufd_device_unbind()`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_device_unbind "iommufd_device_unbind")

bool iommufd_ctx_has_group(struct iommufd_ctx \*ictx, struct iommu_group \*group)
:   True if any device within the group is bound to the ictx

**Parameters**

`struct iommufd_ctx *ictx`
:   iommufd file descriptor

`struct iommu_group *group`
:   Pointer to a physical iommu_group struct

**Description**

True if any device within the group has been bound to this ictx, ex. via
[`iommufd_device_bind()`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_device_bind "iommufd_device_bind"), therefore implying ictx ownership of the group.

void iommufd_device_unbind(struct iommufd_device \*idev)
:   Undo [`iommufd_device_bind()`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_device_bind "iommufd_device_bind")

**Parameters**

`struct iommufd_device *idev`
:   Device returned by [`iommufd_device_bind()`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_device_bind "iommufd_device_bind")

**Description**

Release the device from iommufd control. The DMA ownership will return back
to unowned with DMA controlled by the DMA API. This invalidates the
iommufd_device pointer, other APIs that consume it must not be called
concurrently.

int iommufd_device_attach(struct iommufd_device \*idev, ioasid_t pasid, u32 \*pt_id)
:   Connect a device/pasid to an iommu_domain

**Parameters**

`struct iommufd_device *idev`
:   device to attach

`ioasid_t pasid`
:   pasid to attach

`u32 *pt_id`
:   Input a IOMMUFD_OBJ_IOAS, or IOMMUFD_OBJ_HWPT_PAGING
    Output the IOMMUFD_OBJ_HWPT_PAGING ID

**Description**

This connects the device/pasid to an iommu_domain, either automatically
or manually selected. Once this completes the device could do DMA with
**pasid**. **pasid** is IOMMU_NO_PASID if this attach is for no pasid usage.

The caller should return the resulting pt_id back to userspace.
This function is undone by calling [`iommufd_device_detach()`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_device_detach "iommufd_device_detach").

int iommufd_device_replace(struct iommufd_device \*idev, ioasid_t pasid, u32 \*pt_id)
:   Change the device/pasid’s iommu_domain

**Parameters**

`struct iommufd_device *idev`
:   device to change

`ioasid_t pasid`
:   pasid to change

`u32 *pt_id`
:   Input a IOMMUFD_OBJ_IOAS, or IOMMUFD_OBJ_HWPT_PAGING
    Output the IOMMUFD_OBJ_HWPT_PAGING ID

**Description**

This is the same as:

```
iommufd_device_detach();
iommufd_device_attach();
```

If it fails then no change is made to the attachment. The iommu driver may
implement this so there is no disruption in translation. This can only be
called if [`iommufd_device_attach()`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_device_attach "iommufd_device_attach") has already succeeded. **pasid** is
IOMMU_NO_PASID for no pasid usage.

void iommufd_device_detach(struct iommufd_device \*idev, ioasid_t pasid)
:   Disconnect a device/device to an iommu_domain

**Parameters**

`struct iommufd_device *idev`
:   device to detach

`ioasid_t pasid`
:   pasid to detach

**Description**

Undo [`iommufd_device_attach()`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_device_attach "iommufd_device_attach"). This disconnects the idev from the previously
attached pt_id. The device returns back to a blocked DMA translation.
**pasid** is IOMMU_NO_PASID for no pasid usage.

struct iommufd_access \*iommufd_access_create(struct iommufd_ctx \*ictx, const struct iommufd_access_ops \*ops, void \*data, u32 \*id)
:   Create an iommufd_access

**Parameters**

`struct iommufd_ctx *ictx`
:   iommufd file descriptor

`const struct iommufd_access_ops *ops`
:   Driver’s ops to associate with the access

`void *data`
:   Opaque data to pass into ops functions

`u32 *id`
:   Output ID number to return to userspace for this access

**Description**

An iommufd_access allows a driver to read/write to the IOAS without using
DMA. The underlying CPU memory can be accessed using the
[`iommufd_access_pin_pages()`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_access_pin_pages "iommufd_access_pin_pages") or [`iommufd_access_rw()`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_access_rw "iommufd_access_rw") functions.

The provided ops are required to use [`iommufd_access_pin_pages()`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_access_pin_pages "iommufd_access_pin_pages").

void iommufd_access_destroy(struct iommufd_access \*access)
:   Destroy an iommufd_access

**Parameters**

`struct iommufd_access *access`
:   The access to destroy

**Description**

The caller must stop using the access before destroying it.

void iommufd_access_unpin_pages(struct iommufd_access \*access, unsigned long iova, unsigned long length)
:   Undo iommufd_access_pin_pages

**Parameters**

`struct iommufd_access *access`
:   IOAS access to act on

`unsigned long iova`
:   Starting IOVA

`unsigned long length`
:   Number of bytes to access

**Description**

Return the `struct page`’s. The caller must stop accessing them before calling
this. The iova/length must exactly match the one provided to access_pages.

int iommufd_access_pin_pages(struct iommufd_access \*access, unsigned long iova, unsigned long length, struct page \*\*out_pages, unsigned int flags)
:   Return a list of pages under the iova

**Parameters**

`struct iommufd_access *access`
:   IOAS access to act on

`unsigned long iova`
:   Starting IOVA

`unsigned long length`
:   Number of bytes to access

`struct page **out_pages`
:   Output page list

`unsigned int flags`
:   IOPMMUFD_ACCESS_RW_\* flags

**Description**

Reads **length** bytes starting at iova and returns the `struct page` \* pointers.
These can be kmap’d by the caller for CPU access.

The caller must perform [`iommufd_access_unpin_pages()`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_access_unpin_pages "iommufd_access_unpin_pages") when done to balance
this.

This API always requires a page aligned iova. This happens naturally if the
ioas alignment is >= PAGE_SIZE and the iova is PAGE_SIZE aligned. However
smaller alignments have corner cases where this API can fail on otherwise
aligned iova.

int iommufd_access_rw(struct iommufd_access \*access, unsigned long iova, void \*data, size_t length, unsigned int flags)
:   Read or write data under the iova

**Parameters**

`struct iommufd_access *access`
:   IOAS access to act on

`unsigned long iova`
:   Starting IOVA

`void *data`
:   Kernel buffer to copy to/from

`size_t length`
:   Number of bytes to access

`unsigned int flags`
:   IOMMUFD_ACCESS_RW_\* flags

**Description**

Copy kernel to/from data into the range given by IOVA/length. If flags
indicates IOMMUFD_ACCESS_RW_KTHREAD then a large copy can be optimized
by changing it into copy_to/`from_user()`.

void iommufd_ctx_get(struct iommufd_ctx \*ictx)
:   Get a context reference

**Parameters**

`struct iommufd_ctx *ictx`
:   Context to get

**Description**

The caller must already hold a valid reference to ictx.

struct iommufd_ctx \*iommufd_ctx_from_file(struct [file](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_ctx_from_file "file") \*file)
:   Acquires a reference to the iommufd context

**Parameters**

`struct file *file`
:   File to obtain the reference from

**Description**

Returns a pointer to the iommufd_ctx, otherwise ERR_PTR. The [`struct file`](../filesystems/api-summary.md#c.file "file")
remains owned by the caller and the caller must still do fput. On success
the caller is responsible to call [`iommufd_ctx_put()`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_ctx_put "iommufd_ctx_put").

struct iommufd_ctx \*iommufd_ctx_from_fd(int fd)
:   Acquires a reference to the iommufd context

**Parameters**

`int fd`
:   File descriptor to obtain the reference from

**Description**

Returns a pointer to the iommufd_ctx, otherwise ERR_PTR. On success
the caller is responsible to call [`iommufd_ctx_put()`](iommufd.md#c.iommufd_ctx_put "iommufd_ctx_put").

void iommufd_ctx_put(struct iommufd_ctx \*ictx)
:   Put back a reference

**Parameters**

`struct iommufd_ctx *ictx`
:   Context to put back

### VFIO and IOMMUFD

Connecting a VFIO device to iommufd can be done in two ways.

First is a VFIO compatible way by directly implementing the /dev/vfio/vfio
container IOCTLs by mapping them into io_pagetable operations. Doing so allows
the use of iommufd in legacy VFIO applications by symlinking /dev/vfio/vfio to
/dev/iommufd or extending VFIO to SET_CONTAINER using an iommufd instead of a
container fd.

The second approach directly extends VFIO to support a new set of device-centric
user API based on aforementioned IOMMUFD kernel API. It requires userspace
change but better matches the IOMMUFD API semantics and easier to support new
iommufd features when comparing it to the first approach.

Currently both approaches are still work-in-progress.

There are still a few gaps to be resolved to catch up with VFIO type1, as
documented in `iommufd_vfio_check_extension()`.

## Future TODOs

Currently IOMMUFD supports only kernel-managed I/O page table, similar to VFIO
type1. New features on the radar include:

> - Binding iommu_domain’s to PASID/SSID
> - Userspace page tables, for ARM, x86 and S390
> - Kernel bypass’d invalidation of user page tables
> - Re-use of the KVM page table in the IOMMU
> - Dirty page tracking in the IOMMU
> - Runtime Increase/Decrease of IOPTE size
> - PRI support with faults resolved in userspace
