# Dynamic DMA mapping using the generic device

Author:
:   James E.J. Bottomley <[James.Bottomley@HansenPartnership.com](mailto:James.Bottomley%40HansenPartnership.com)>

This document describes the DMA API. For a more gentle introduction
of the API (and actual examples), see [Dynamic DMA mapping Guide](dma-api-howto.md).

This API is split into two pieces. Part I describes the basic API.
Part II describes extensions for supporting non-coherent memory
machines. Unless you know that your driver absolutely has to support
non-coherent platforms (this is usually only legacy platforms) you
should only use the API described in part I.

## Part I - DMA API

To get the DMA API, you must #include <linux/dma-mapping.h>. This
provides dma_addr_t and the interfaces described below.

A dma_addr_t can hold any valid DMA address for the platform. It can be
given to a device to use as a DMA source or target. A CPU cannot reference
a dma_addr_t directly because there may be translation between its physical
address space and the DMA address space.

## Part Ia - Using large DMA-coherent buffers

```
void *
dma_alloc_coherent(struct device *dev, size_t size,
                   dma_addr_t *dma_handle, gfp_t flag)
```

Coherent memory is memory for which a write by either the device or
the processor can immediately be read by the processor or device
without having to worry about caching effects. (You may however need
to make sure to flush the processor’s write buffers before telling
devices to read that memory.)

This routine allocates a region of <size> bytes of coherent memory.

It returns a pointer to the allocated region (in the processor’s virtual
address space) or NULL if the allocation failed.

It also returns a <dma_handle> which may be cast to an unsigned integer the
same width as the bus and given to the device as the DMA address base of
the region.

Note: coherent memory can be expensive on some platforms, and the
minimum allocation length may be as big as a page, so you should
consolidate your requests for coherent memory as much as possible.
The simplest way to do that is to use the dma_pool calls (see below).

The flag parameter allows the caller to specify the `GFP_` flags (see
[`kmalloc()`](mm-api.md#c.kmalloc "kmalloc")) for the allocation (the implementation may ignore flags that affect
the location of the returned memory, like GFP_DMA).

```
void
dma_free_coherent(struct device *dev, size_t size, void *cpu_addr,
                  dma_addr_t dma_handle)
```

Free a previously allocated region of coherent memory. dev, size and dma_handle
must all be the same as those passed into `dma_alloc_coherent()`. cpu_addr must
be the virtual address returned by `dma_alloc_coherent()`.

Note that unlike the sibling allocation call, this routine may only be called
with IRQs enabled.

## Part Ib - Using small DMA-coherent buffers

To get this part of the DMA API, you must #include <linux/dmapool.h>

Many drivers need lots of small DMA-coherent memory regions for DMA
descriptors or I/O buffers. Rather than allocating in units of a page
or more using `dma_alloc_coherent()`, you can use DMA pools. These work
much like a `struct kmem_cache`, except that they use the DMA-coherent allocator,
not `__get_free_pages()`. Also, they understand common hardware constraints
for alignment, like queue heads needing to be aligned on N-byte boundaries.

struct dma_pool \*dma_pool_create_node(const char \*name, struct [device](../driver-api/infrastructure.md#c.device "device") \*dev, size_t size, size_t align, size_t boundary, int node)
:   Creates a pool of coherent DMA memory blocks.

**Parameters**

`const char *name`
:   name of pool, for diagnostics

`struct device *dev`
:   device that will be doing the DMA

`size_t size`
:   size of the blocks in this pool.

`size_t align`
:   alignment requirement for blocks; must be a power of two

`size_t boundary`
:   returned blocks won’t cross this power of two boundary

`int node`
:   optional NUMA node to allocate structs ‘dma_pool’ and ‘dma_page’ on

**Context**

not `in_interrupt()`

**Description**

Given one of these pools, [`dma_pool_alloc()`](dma-api.md#c.dma_pool_alloc "dma_pool_alloc")
may be used to allocate memory. Such memory will all have coherent
DMA mappings, accessible by the device and its driver without using
cache flushing primitives. The actual size of blocks allocated may be
larger than requested because of alignment.

If **boundary** is nonzero, objects returned from [`dma_pool_alloc()`](dma-api.md#c.dma_pool_alloc "dma_pool_alloc") won’t
cross that size boundary. This is useful for devices which have
addressing restrictions on individual DMA transfers, such as not crossing
boundaries of 4KBytes.

**Return**

a dma allocation pool with the requested characteristics, or
`NULL` if one can’t be created.

void dma_pool_destroy(struct dma_pool \*pool)
:   destroys a pool of dma memory blocks.

**Parameters**

`struct dma_pool *pool`
:   dma pool that will be destroyed

**Context**

!`in_interrupt()`

**Description**

Caller guarantees that no more memory from the pool is in use,
and that nothing will try to use the pool after this call.

void \*dma_pool_alloc(struct dma_pool \*pool, gfp_t mem_flags, dma_addr_t \*handle)
:   get a block of coherent memory

**Parameters**

`struct dma_pool *pool`
:   dma pool that will produce the block

`gfp_t mem_flags`
:   GFP_\* bitmask

`dma_addr_t *handle`
:   pointer to dma address of block

**Return**

the kernel virtual address of a currently unused block,
and reports its dma address through the handle.
If such a memory block can’t be allocated, `NULL` is returned.

void dma_pool_free(struct dma_pool \*pool, void \*vaddr, dma_addr_t dma)
:   put block back into dma pool

**Parameters**

`struct dma_pool *pool`
:   the dma pool holding the block

`void *vaddr`
:   virtual address of block

`dma_addr_t dma`
:   dma address of block

**Description**

Caller promises neither device nor driver will again touch this block
unless it is first re-allocated.

struct dma_pool \*dmam_pool_create(const char \*name, struct [device](../driver-api/infrastructure.md#c.device "device") \*dev, size_t size, size_t align, size_t allocation)
:   Managed `dma_pool_create()`

**Parameters**

`const char *name`
:   name of pool, for diagnostics

`struct device *dev`
:   device that will be doing the DMA

`size_t size`
:   size of the blocks in this pool.

`size_t align`
:   alignment requirement for blocks; must be a power of two

`size_t allocation`
:   returned blocks won’t cross this boundary (or zero)

**Description**

Managed `dma_pool_create()`. DMA pool created with this function is
automatically destroyed on driver detach.

**Return**

a managed dma allocation pool with the requested
characteristics, or `NULL` if one can’t be created.

void dmam_pool_destroy(struct dma_pool \*pool)
:   Managed [`dma_pool_destroy()`](dma-api.md#c.dma_pool_destroy "dma_pool_destroy")

**Parameters**

`struct dma_pool *pool`
:   dma pool that will be destroyed

**Description**

Managed [`dma_pool_destroy()`](dma-api.md#c.dma_pool_destroy "dma_pool_destroy").

void \*dma_pool_zalloc(struct dma_pool \*pool, gfp_t mem_flags, dma_addr_t \*handle)
:   Get a zero-initialized block of DMA coherent memory.

**Parameters**

`struct dma_pool *pool`
:   dma pool that will produce the block

`gfp_t mem_flags`
:   GFP_\* bitmask

`dma_addr_t *handle`
:   pointer to dma address of block

**Description**

Same as [`dma_pool_alloc()`](dma-api.md#c.dma_pool_alloc "dma_pool_alloc"), but the returned memory is zeroed.

## Part Ic - DMA addressing limitations

DMA mask is a bit mask of the addressable region for the device. In other words,
if applying the DMA mask (a bitwise AND operation) to the DMA address of a
memory region does not clear any bits in the address, then the device can
perform DMA to that memory region.

All the below functions which set a DMA mask may fail if the requested mask
cannot be used with the device, or if the device is not capable of doing DMA.

```
int
dma_set_mask_and_coherent(struct device *dev, u64 mask)
```

Updates both streaming and coherent DMA masks.

Returns: 0 if successful and a negative error if not.

```
int
dma_set_mask(struct device *dev, u64 mask)
```

Updates only the streaming DMA mask.

Returns: 0 if successful and a negative error if not.

```
int
dma_set_coherent_mask(struct device *dev, u64 mask)
```

Updates only the coherent DMA mask.

Returns: 0 if successful and a negative error if not.

```
u64
dma_get_required_mask(struct device *dev)
```

This API returns the mask that the platform requires to
operate efficiently. Usually this means the returned mask
is the minimum required to cover all of memory. Examining the
required mask gives drivers with variable descriptor sizes the
opportunity to use smaller descriptors as necessary.

Requesting the required mask does not alter the current mask. If you
wish to take advantage of it, you should issue a `dma_set_mask()`
call to set the mask to the value returned.

```
size_t
dma_max_mapping_size(struct device *dev);
```

Returns the maximum size of a mapping for the device. The size parameter
of the mapping functions like `dma_map_single()`, `dma_map_page()` and
others should not be larger than the returned value.

```
size_t
dma_opt_mapping_size(struct device *dev);
```

Returns the maximum optimal size of a mapping for the device.

Mapping larger buffers may take much longer in certain scenarios. In
addition, for high-rate short-lived streaming mappings, the upfront time
spent on the mapping may account for an appreciable part of the total
request lifetime. As such, if splitting larger requests incurs no
significant performance penalty, then device drivers are advised to
limit total DMA streaming mappings length to the returned value.

```
bool
dma_need_sync(struct device *dev, dma_addr_t dma_addr);
```

Returns %true if dma_sync_single_for_{device,cpu} calls are required to
transfer memory ownership. Returns %false if those calls can be skipped.

```
unsigned long
dma_get_merge_boundary(struct device *dev);
```

Returns the DMA merge boundary. If the device cannot merge any DMA address
segments, the function returns 0.

## Part Id - Streaming DMA mappings

Streaming DMA allows to map an existing buffer for DMA transfers and then
unmap it when finished. Map functions are not guaranteed to succeed, so the
return value must be checked.

> **Note:**
>
> In particular, mapping may fail for memory not addressable by the
> device, e.g. if it is not within the DMA mask of the device and/or a
> connecting bus bridge. Streaming DMA functions try to overcome such

```
dma_addr_t
dma_map_single(struct device *dev, void *cpu_addr, size_t size,
               enum dma_data_direction direction)
```

Maps a piece of processor virtual memory so it can be accessed by the
device and returns the DMA address of the memory.

The DMA API uses a strongly typed enumerator for its direction:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| DMA_NONE | no direction (used for debugging) |
| DMA_TO_DEVICE | data is going from the memory to the device |
| DMA_FROM_DEVICE | data is coming from the device to the memory |
| DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL | direction isn’t known |

> **Note:**
>
> Contiguous kernel virtual space may not be contiguous as
> physical memory. Since this API does not provide any scatter/gather
> capability, it will fail if the user tries to map a non-physically
> contiguous piece of memory. For this reason, memory to be mapped by
> this API should be obtained from sources which guarantee it to be
> physically contiguous (like kmalloc).

> **Warning:**
>
> Memory coherency operates at a granularity called the cache
> line width. In order for memory mapped by this API to operate
> correctly, the mapped region must begin exactly on a cache line
> boundary and end exactly on one (to prevent two separately mapped
> regions from sharing a single cache line). Since the cache line size
> may not be known at compile time, the API will not enforce this
> requirement. Therefore, it is recommended that driver writers who
> don’t take special care to determine the cache line size at run time
> only map virtual regions that begin and end on page boundaries (which
> are guaranteed also to be cache line boundaries).
>
> DMA_TO_DEVICE synchronisation must be done after the last modification
> of the memory region by the software and before it is handed off to
> the device. Once this primitive is used, memory covered by this
> primitive should be treated as read-only by the device. If the device
> may write to it at any point, it should be DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL (see
> below).

```
void
dma_unmap_single(struct device *dev, dma_addr_t dma_addr, size_t size,
                 enum dma_data_direction direction)
```

Unmaps the region previously mapped. All the parameters passed in
must be identical to those passed to (and returned by) `dma_map_single()`.

```
dma_addr_t
dma_map_page(struct device *dev, struct page *page,
             unsigned long offset, size_t size,
             enum dma_data_direction direction)

void
dma_unmap_page(struct device *dev, dma_addr_t dma_address, size_t size,
               enum dma_data_direction direction)
```

API for mapping and unmapping for pages. All the notes and warnings
for the other mapping APIs apply here. Also, although the <offset>
and <size> parameters are provided to do partial page mapping, it is
recommended that you never use these unless you really know what the
cache width is.

```
dma_addr_t
dma_map_resource(struct device *dev, phys_addr_t phys_addr, size_t size,
                 enum dma_data_direction dir, unsigned long attrs)

void
dma_unmap_resource(struct device *dev, dma_addr_t addr, size_t size,
                   enum dma_data_direction dir, unsigned long attrs)
```

API for mapping and unmapping for MMIO resources. All the notes and
warnings for the other mapping APIs apply here. The API should only be
used to map device MMIO resources, mapping of RAM is not permitted.

```
int
dma_mapping_error(struct device *dev, dma_addr_t dma_addr)
```

In some circumstances `dma_map_single()`, `dma_map_page()` and `dma_map_resource()`
will fail to create a mapping. A driver can check for these errors by testing
the returned DMA address with `dma_mapping_error()`. A non-zero return value
means the mapping could not be created and the driver should take appropriate
action (e.g. reduce current DMA mapping usage or delay and try again later).

```
int
dma_map_sg(struct device *dev, struct scatterlist *sg,
           int nents, enum dma_data_direction direction)
```

Maps a scatter/gather list for DMA. Returns the number of DMA address segments
mapped, which may be smaller than <nents> passed in if several consecutive
sglist entries are merged (e.g. with an IOMMU, or if some adjacent segments
just happen to be physically contiguous).

Please note that the sg cannot be mapped again if it has been mapped once.
The mapping process is allowed to destroy information in the sg.

As with the other mapping interfaces, `dma_map_sg()` can fail. When it
does, 0 is returned and a driver must take appropriate action. It is
critical that the driver do something, in the case of a block driver
aborting the request or even oopsing is better than doing nothing and
corrupting the filesystem.

With scatterlists, you use the resulting mapping like this:

```
int i, count = dma_map_sg(dev, sglist, nents, direction);
struct scatterlist *sg;

for_each_sg(sglist, sg, count, i) {
        hw_address[i] = sg_dma_address(sg);
        hw_len[i] = sg_dma_len(sg);
}
```

where nents is the number of entries in the sglist.

The implementation is free to merge several consecutive sglist entries
into one. The returned number is the actual number of sg entries it
mapped them to. On failure, 0 is returned.

Then you should loop count times (note: this can be less than nents times)
and use `sg_dma_address()` and `sg_dma_len()` macros where you previously
accessed sg->address and sg->length as shown above.

```
void
dma_unmap_sg(struct device *dev, struct scatterlist *sg,
             int nents, enum dma_data_direction direction)
```

Unmap the previously mapped scatter/gather list. All the parameters
must be the same as those and passed in to the scatter/gather mapping
API.

Note: <nents> must be the number you passed in, *not* the number of
DMA address entries returned.

```
void
dma_sync_single_for_cpu(struct device *dev, dma_addr_t dma_handle,
                        size_t size,
                        enum dma_data_direction direction)

void
dma_sync_single_for_device(struct device *dev, dma_addr_t dma_handle,
                           size_t size,
                           enum dma_data_direction direction)

void
dma_sync_sg_for_cpu(struct device *dev, struct scatterlist *sg,
                    int nents,
                    enum dma_data_direction direction)

void
dma_sync_sg_for_device(struct device *dev, struct scatterlist *sg,
                       int nents,
                       enum dma_data_direction direction)
```

Synchronise a single contiguous or scatter/gather mapping for the CPU
and device. With the sync_sg API, all the parameters must be the same
as those passed into the sg mapping API. With the sync_single API,
you can use dma_handle and size parameters that aren’t identical to
those passed into the single mapping API to do a partial sync.

> **Note:**
>
> You must do this:
>
> - Before reading values that have been written by DMA from the device
>   (use the DMA_FROM_DEVICE direction)
> - After writing values that will be written to the device using DMA
>   (use the DMA_TO_DEVICE) direction
> - before *and* after handing memory to the device if the memory is
>   DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL

See also `dma_map_single()`.

```
dma_addr_t
dma_map_single_attrs(struct device *dev, void *cpu_addr, size_t size,
                     enum dma_data_direction dir,
                     unsigned long attrs)

void
dma_unmap_single_attrs(struct device *dev, dma_addr_t dma_addr,
                       size_t size, enum dma_data_direction dir,
                       unsigned long attrs)

int
dma_map_sg_attrs(struct device *dev, struct scatterlist *sgl,
                 int nents, enum dma_data_direction dir,
                 unsigned long attrs)

void
dma_unmap_sg_attrs(struct device *dev, struct scatterlist *sgl,
                   int nents, enum dma_data_direction dir,
                   unsigned long attrs)
```

The four functions above are just like the counterpart functions
without the _attrs suffixes, except that they pass an optional
dma_attrs.

The interpretation of DMA attributes is architecture-specific, and
each attribute should be documented in
[DMA attributes](dma-attributes.md).

If dma_attrs are 0, the semantics of each of these functions
is identical to those of the corresponding function
without the _attrs suffix. As a result `dma_map_single_attrs()`
can generally replace `dma_map_single()`, etc.

As an example of the use of the `*_attrs` functions, here’s how
you could pass an attribute DMA_ATTR_FOO when mapping memory
for DMA:

```
#include <linux/dma-mapping.h>
/* DMA_ATTR_FOO should be defined in linux/dma-mapping.h and
* documented in Documentation/core-api/dma-attributes.rst */
...

        unsigned long attr;
        attr |= DMA_ATTR_FOO;
        ....
        n = dma_map_sg_attrs(dev, sg, nents, DMA_TO_DEVICE, attr);
        ....
```

Architectures that care about DMA_ATTR_FOO would check for its
presence in their implementations of the mapping and unmapping
routines, e.g.::

```
void whizco_dma_map_sg_attrs(struct device *dev, dma_addr_t dma_addr,
                             size_t size, enum dma_data_direction dir,
                             unsigned long attrs)
{
        ....
        if (attrs & DMA_ATTR_FOO)
                /* twizzle the frobnozzle */
        ....
}
```

## Part Ie - IOVA-based DMA mappings

These APIs allow a very efficient mapping when using an IOMMU. They are an
optional path that requires extra code and are only recommended for drivers
where DMA mapping performance, or the space usage for storing the DMA addresses
matter. All the considerations from the previous section apply here as well.

```
bool dma_iova_try_alloc(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
            phys_addr_t phys, size_t size);
```

Is used to try to allocate IOVA space for mapping operation. If it returns
false this API can’t be used for the given device and the normal streaming
DMA mapping API should be used. The `struct dma_iova_state` is allocated
by the driver and must be kept around until unmap time.

```
static inline bool dma_use_iova(struct dma_iova_state *state)
```

Can be used by the driver to check if the IOVA-based API is used after a
call to dma_iova_try_alloc. This can be useful in the unmap path.

```
int dma_iova_link(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
            phys_addr_t phys, size_t offset, size_t size,
            enum dma_data_direction dir, unsigned long attrs);
```

Is used to link ranges to the IOVA previously allocated. The start of all
but the first call to dma_iova_link for a given state must be aligned
to the DMA merge boundary returned by `dma_get_merge_boundary())`, and
the size of all but the last range must be aligned to the DMA merge boundary
as well.

```
int dma_iova_sync(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
            size_t offset, size_t size);
```

Must be called to sync the IOMMU page tables for IOVA-range mapped by one or
more calls to `dma_iova_link()`.

For drivers that use a one-shot mapping, all ranges can be unmapped and the
IOVA freed by calling:

```
void dma_iova_destroy(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
             size_t mapped_len, enum dma_data_direction dir,
             unsigned long attrs);
```

Alternatively drivers can dynamically manage the IOVA space by unmapping
and mapping individual regions. In that case

```
void dma_iova_unlink(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
            size_t offset, size_t size, enum dma_data_direction dir,
            unsigned long attrs);
```

is used to unmap a range previously mapped, and

```
void dma_iova_free(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state);
```

is used to free the IOVA space. All regions must have been unmapped using
`dma_iova_unlink()` before calling `dma_iova_free()`.

## Part II - Non-coherent DMA allocations

These APIs allow to allocate pages that are guaranteed to be DMA addressable
by the passed in device, but which need explicit management of memory ownership
for the kernel vs the device.

If you don’t understand how cache line coherency works between a processor and
an I/O device, you should not be using this part of the API.

```
struct page *
dma_alloc_pages(struct device *dev, size_t size, dma_addr_t *dma_handle,
                enum dma_data_direction dir, gfp_t gfp)
```

This routine allocates a region of <size> bytes of non-coherent memory. It
returns a pointer to first `struct page` for the region, or NULL if the
allocation failed. The resulting `struct page` can be used for everything a
`struct page` is suitable for.

It also returns a <dma_handle> which may be cast to an unsigned integer the
same width as the bus and given to the device as the DMA address base of
the region.

The dir parameter specified if data is read and/or written by the device,
see `dma_map_single()` for details.

The gfp parameter allows the caller to specify the `GFP_` flags (see
[`kmalloc()`](mm-api.md#c.kmalloc "kmalloc")) for the allocation, but rejects flags used to specify a memory
zone such as GFP_DMA or GFP_HIGHMEM.

Before giving the memory to the device, `dma_sync_single_for_device()` needs
to be called, and before reading memory written by the device,
`dma_sync_single_for_cpu()`, just like for streaming DMA mappings that are
reused.

```
void
dma_free_pages(struct device *dev, size_t size, struct page *page,
                dma_addr_t dma_handle, enum dma_data_direction dir)
```

Free a region of memory previously allocated using `dma_alloc_pages()`.
dev, size, dma_handle and dir must all be the same as those passed into
`dma_alloc_pages()`. page must be the pointer returned by `dma_alloc_pages()`.

```
int
dma_mmap_pages(struct device *dev, struct vm_area_struct *vma,
               size_t size, struct page *page)
```

Map an allocation returned from `dma_alloc_pages()` into a user address space.
dev and size must be the same as those passed into `dma_alloc_pages()`.
page must be the pointer returned by `dma_alloc_pages()`.

```
void *
dma_alloc_noncoherent(struct device *dev, size_t size,
                dma_addr_t *dma_handle, enum dma_data_direction dir,
                gfp_t gfp)
```

This routine is a convenient wrapper around dma_alloc_pages that returns the
kernel virtual address for the allocated memory instead of the page structure.

```
void
dma_free_noncoherent(struct device *dev, size_t size, void *cpu_addr,
                dma_addr_t dma_handle, enum dma_data_direction dir)
```

Free a region of memory previously allocated using `dma_alloc_noncoherent()`.
dev, size, dma_handle and dir must all be the same as those passed into
`dma_alloc_noncoherent()`. cpu_addr must be the virtual address returned by
`dma_alloc_noncoherent()`.

```
struct sg_table *
dma_alloc_noncontiguous(struct device *dev, size_t size,
                        enum dma_data_direction dir, gfp_t gfp,
                        unsigned long attrs);
```

This routine allocates <size> bytes of non-coherent and possibly non-contiguous
memory. It returns a pointer to `struct sg_table` that describes the allocated
and DMA mapped memory, or NULL if the allocation failed. The resulting memory
can be used for `struct page` mapped into a scatterlist are suitable for.

The return sg_table is guaranteed to have 1 single DMA mapped segment as
indicated by sgt->nents, but it might have multiple CPU side segments as
indicated by sgt->orig_nents.

The dir parameter specified if data is read and/or written by the device,
see `dma_map_single()` for details.

The gfp parameter allows the caller to specify the `GFP_` flags (see
[`kmalloc()`](mm-api.md#c.kmalloc "kmalloc")) for the allocation, but rejects flags used to specify a memory
zone such as GFP_DMA or GFP_HIGHMEM.

The attrs argument must be either 0 or DMA_ATTR_ALLOC_SINGLE_PAGES.

Before giving the memory to the device, `dma_sync_sgtable_for_device()` needs
to be called, and before reading memory written by the device,
`dma_sync_sgtable_for_cpu()`, just like for streaming DMA mappings that are
reused.

```
void
dma_free_noncontiguous(struct device *dev, size_t size,
                       struct sg_table *sgt,
                       enum dma_data_direction dir)
```

Free memory previously allocated using `dma_alloc_noncontiguous()`. dev, size,
and dir must all be the same as those passed into `dma_alloc_noncontiguous()`.
sgt must be the pointer returned by `dma_alloc_noncontiguous()`.

```
void *
dma_vmap_noncontiguous(struct device *dev, size_t size,
        struct sg_table *sgt)
```

Return a contiguous kernel mapping for an allocation returned from
`dma_alloc_noncontiguous()`. dev and size must be the same as those passed into
`dma_alloc_noncontiguous()`. sgt must be the pointer returned by
`dma_alloc_noncontiguous()`.

Once a non-contiguous allocation is mapped using this function, the
`flush_kernel_vmap_range()` and `invalidate_kernel_vmap_range()` APIs must be used
to manage the coherency between the kernel mapping, the device and user space
mappings (if any).

```
void
dma_vunmap_noncontiguous(struct device *dev, void *vaddr)
```

Unmap a kernel mapping returned by `dma_vmap_noncontiguous()`. dev must be the
same the one passed into `dma_alloc_noncontiguous()`. vaddr must be the pointer
returned by `dma_vmap_noncontiguous()`.

```
int
dma_mmap_noncontiguous(struct device *dev, struct vm_area_struct *vma,
                       size_t size, struct sg_table *sgt)
```

Map an allocation returned from `dma_alloc_noncontiguous()` into a user address
space. dev and size must be the same as those passed into
`dma_alloc_noncontiguous()`. sgt must be the pointer returned by
`dma_alloc_noncontiguous()`.

```
int
dma_get_cache_alignment(void)
```

Returns the processor cache alignment. This is the absolute minimum
alignment *and* width that you must observe when either mapping
memory or doing partial flushes.

> **Note:**
>
> This API may return a number *larger* than the actual cache
> line, but it will guarantee that one or more cache lines fit exactly
> into the width returned by this call. It will also always be a power
> of two for easy alignment.

## Part III - Debug drivers use of the DMA API

The DMA API as described above has some constraints. DMA addresses must be
released with the corresponding function with the same size for example. With
the advent of hardware IOMMUs it becomes more and more important that drivers
do not violate those constraints. In the worst case such a violation can
result in data corruption up to destroyed filesystems.

To debug drivers and find bugs in the usage of the DMA API checking code can
be compiled into the kernel which will tell the developer about those
violations. If your architecture supports it you can select the “Enable
debugging of DMA API usage” option in your kernel configuration. Enabling this
option has a performance impact. Do not enable it in production kernels.

If you boot the resulting kernel will contain code which does some bookkeeping
about what DMA memory was allocated for which device. If this code detects an
error it prints a warning message with some details into your kernel log. An
example warning message may look like this:

```

```

The driver developer can find the driver and the device including a stacktrace
of the DMA API call which caused this warning.

Per default only the first error will result in a warning message. All other
errors will only silently counted. This limitation exist to prevent the code
from flooding your kernel log. To support debugging a device driver this can
be disabled via debugfs. See the debugfs interface documentation below for
details.

The debugfs directory for the DMA API debugging code is called dma-api/. In
this directory the following files can currently be found:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| dma-api/all_errors | This file contains a numeric value. If this value is not equal to zero the debugging code will print a warning for every error it finds into the kernel log. Be careful with this option, as it can easily flood your logs. |
| dma-api/disabled | This read-only file contains the character ‘Y’ if the debugging code is disabled. This can happen when it runs out of memory or if it was disabled at boot time |
| dma-api/dump | This read-only file contains current DMA mappings. |
| dma-api/error_count | This file is read-only and shows the total numbers of errors found. |
| dma-api/num_errors | The number in this file shows how many warnings will be printed to the kernel log before it stops. This number is initialized to one at system boot and be set by writing into this file |
| dma-api/min_free_entries | This read-only file can be read to get the minimum number of free dma_debug_entries the allocator has ever seen. If this value goes down to zero the code will attempt to increase nr_total_entries to compensate. |
| dma-api/num_free_entries | The current number of free dma_debug_entries in the allocator. |
| dma-api/nr_total_entries | The total number of dma_debug_entries in the allocator, both free and used. |
| dma-api/driver_filter | You can write a name of a driver into this file to limit the debug output to requests from that particular driver. Write an empty string to that file to disable the filter and see all errors again. |

If you have this code compiled into your kernel it will be enabled by default.
If you want to boot without the bookkeeping anyway you can provide
‘dma_debug=off’ as a boot parameter. This will disable DMA API debugging.
Notice that you can not enable it again at runtime. You have to reboot to do
so.

If you want to see debug messages only for a special device driver you can
specify the dma_debug_driver=<drivername> parameter. This will enable the
driver filter at boot time. The debug code will only print errors for that
driver afterwards. This filter can be disabled or changed later using debugfs.

When the code disables itself at runtime this is most likely because it ran
out of dma_debug_entries and was unable to allocate more on-demand. 65536
entries are preallocated at boot - if this is too low for you boot with
‘dma_debug_entries=<your_desired_number>’ to overwrite the default. Note
that the code allocates entries in batches, so the exact number of
preallocated entries may be greater than the actual number requested. The
code will print to the kernel log each time it has dynamically allocated
as many entries as were initially preallocated. This is to indicate that a
larger preallocation size may be appropriate, or if it happens continually
that a driver may be leaking mappings.

```
void
debug_dma_mapping_error(struct device *dev, dma_addr_t dma_addr);
```

dma-debug interface `debug_dma_mapping_error()` to debug drivers that fail
to check DMA mapping errors on addresses returned by `dma_map_single()` and
`dma_map_page()` interfaces. This interface clears a flag set by
`debug_dma_map_page()` to indicate that `dma_mapping_error()` has been called by
the driver. When driver does unmap, `debug_dma_unmap()` checks the flag and if
this flag is still set, prints warning message that includes call trace that
leads up to the unmap. This interface can be called from `dma_mapping_error()`
routines to enable DMA mapping error check debugging.

:   The sg append table to use

`struct page **pages`
:   Pointer to an array of page pointers

**Description**

> In the first call it allocate and initialize an sg table from a list of
> pages, else reuse the scatterlist from sgt_append. Contiguous ranges of
> the pages are squashed into a single scatterlist entry up to the maximum
> size specified in **max_segment**. A user may provide an offset at a start
> and a size of valid data in a buffer specified by the page array. The
> returned sg table is released by sg_free_append_table

**Return**

0 on success, negative error on failure

**Notes**

> If this function returns non-0 (eg failure), the caller must call
> [`sg_free_append_table()`](dma-api.md#c.sg_free_append_table "sg_free_append_table") to cleanup any leftover allocations.
>
> In the fist call, sgt_append must by initialized.

:   allocate a scatterlist and its pages

**Parameters**

`unsigned long long length`
:   Length in bytes of the scatterlist

- If several scatterlists have been chained and each chain element is
  freed separately then it’s essential to set nents correctly to avoid that a
  page would get freed twice.
- All pages in a chained scatterlist can be freed at once by setting **nents**
  to a high number.

Extract the page fragments from the given amount of the source iterator and
add them to a scatterlist that refers to all of those bits, to a maximum
addition of **sg_max** elements.

The pages referred to by UBUF- and IOVEC-type iterators are extracted and
pinned; BVEC-, KVEC-, FOLIOQ- and XARRAY-type are extracted but aren’t
pinned; DISCARD-type is not supported.

No end mark is placed on the scatterlist; that’s left to the caller.

**extraction_flags** can have ITER_ALLOW_P2PDMA set to request peer-to-peer DMA
be allowed on the pages extracted.

If successful, **sgtable->nents** is updated to include the number of elements
added and the number of bytes added is returned. **sgtable->orig_nents** is
left unaltered.

The `iov_iter_extract_mode()` function should be used to query how cleanup
should be performed.
