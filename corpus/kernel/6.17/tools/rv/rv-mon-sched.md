# rv-mon-sched

## Scheduler monitors collection

Manual section:
:   1

### SYNOPSIS

**rv mon sched** [*OPTIONS*]

**rv mon <NESTED_MONITOR>** [*OPTIONS*]

**rv mon sched:<NESTED_MONITOR>** [*OPTIONS*]

### DESCRIPTION

The scheduler monitor collection is a container for several monitors to model
the behaviour of the scheduler. Each monitor describes a specification that
the scheduler should follow.

As a monitor container, it will enable all nested monitors and set them
according to OPTIONS.
Nevertheless nested monitors can also be activated independently both by name
and by specifying sched: , e.g. to enable only monitor tss you can do any of:

> # rv mon sched:tss
>
> # rv mon tss

See kernel documentation for further information about this monitor:
<<https://docs.kernel.org/trace/rv/monitor_sched.html>>

### OPTIONS

**-h**, **--help**

> Print the monitor’s options and the available reactors list.

**-r**, **--reactor** *reactor*

> Enables the *reactor*. See **-h** for a list of available reactors.

**-s**, **--self**

> When tracing (**-t**), also print the events that happened during the **rv**
> command itself. If the **rv** command itself generates too many events,
> the tool might get busy processing its own events only.

**-t**, **--trace**

> Trace monitor’s events and error.

**-v**, **--verbose**

> Print debug messages.

### NESTED MONITOR

The available nested monitors are:
:   - scpd: schedule called with preemption disabled
    - snep: schedule does not enable preempt
    - sncid: schedule not called with interrupt disabled
    - snroc: set non runnable on its own context
    - sco: scheduling context operations
    - tss: task switch while scheduling
