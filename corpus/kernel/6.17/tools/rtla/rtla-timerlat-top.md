# rtla-timerlat-top

## Measures the operating system timer latency

Manual section:
:   1

### SYNOPSIS

**rtla timerlat top** [*OPTIONS*] ...

### DESCRIPTION

The **rtla timerlat** tool is an interface for the *timerlat* tracer. The
*timerlat* tracer dispatches a kernel thread per-cpu. These threads
set a periodic timer to wake themselves up and go back to sleep. After
the wakeup, they collect and generate useful information for the
debugging of operating system timer latency.

The *timerlat* tracer outputs information in two ways. It periodically
prints the timer latency at the timer *IRQ* handler and the *Thread*
handler. It also enables the trace of the most relevant information via
**osnoise:** tracepoints.

The **rtla timerlat** tool sets the options of the *timerlat* tracer
and collects and displays a summary of the results. By default,
the collection is done synchronously in kernel space using a dedicated
BPF program attached to the *timerlat* tracer. If either BPF or
the **osnoise:timerlat_sample** tracepoint it attaches to is
unavailable, the **rtla timerlat** tool falls back to using tracefs to
process the data asynchronously in user space.

The **rtla timerlat top** displays a summary of the periodic output
from the *timerlat* tracer. It also provides information for each
operating system noise via the **osnoise:** tracepoints that can be
seem with the option **-T**.

### OPTIONS

**-a**, **--auto** *us*

> Set the automatic trace mode. This mode sets some commonly used options
> while debugging the system. It is equivalent to use **-T** *us* **-s** *us*
> **-t**. By default, *timerlat* tracer uses FIFO:95 for *timerlat* threads,
> thus equilavent to **-P** *f:95*.

**-p**, **--period** *us*

> Set the *timerlat* tracer period in microseconds.

**-i**, **--irq** *us*

> Stop trace if the *IRQ* latency is higher than the argument in us.

**-T**, **--thread** *us*

> Stop trace if the *Thread* latency is higher than the argument in us.

**-s**, **--stack** *us*

> Save the stack trace at the *IRQ* if a *Thread* latency is higher than the
> argument in us.

**-t**, **--trace** [*file*]

> Save the stopped trace to [*file|timerlat_trace.txt*].

**--dma-latency** *us*
:   Set the /dev/cpu_dma_latency to *us*, aiming to bound exit from idle latencies.
    *cyclictest* sets this value to *0* by default, use **--dma-latency** *0* to have
    similar results.

**--deepest-idle-state** *n*
:   Disable idle states higher than *n* for cpus that are running timerlat threads to
    reduce exit from idle latencies. If *n* is -1, all idle states are disabled.
    On exit from timerlat, the idle state setting is restored to its original state
    before running timerlat.

    Requires rtla to be built with libcpupower.

**-k**, **--kernel-threads**

> Use timerlat kernel-space threads, in contrast of **-u**.

**-u**, **--user-threads**

> Set timerlat to run without a workload, and then dispatches user-space workloads
> to wait on the timerlat_fd. Once the workload is awakes, it goes to sleep again
> adding so the measurement for the kernel-to-user and user-to-kernel to the tracer
> output. **--user-threads** will be used unless the user specify **-k**.

**-U**, **--user-load**

> Set timerlat to run without workload, waiting for the user to dispatch a per-cpu
> task that waits for a new period on the tracing/osnoise/per_cpu/cpu$ID/timerlat_fd.
> See linux/tools/rtla/sample/timerlat_load.py for an example of user-load code.

**--on-threshold** *action*

> Defines an action to be executed when tracing is stopped on a latency threshold
> specified by **-i/--irq** or **-T/--thread**.
>
> Multiple --on-threshold actions may be specified, and they will be executed in
> the order they are provided. If any action fails, subsequent actions in the list
> will not be executed.
>
> Supported actions are:
>
> - *trace[,file=<filename>]*
>
>   Saves trace output, optionally taking a filename. Alternative to -t/--trace.
>   Note that nlike -t/--trace, specifying this multiple times will result in
>   the trace being saved multiple times.
> - *signal,num=<sig>,pid=<pid>*
>
>   Sends signal to process. “parent” might be specified in place of pid to target
>   the parent process of rtla.
> - *shell,command=<command>*
>
>   Execute shell command.
> - *continue*
>
>   Continue tracing after actions are executed instead of stopping.
>
> Example:
>
> $ rtla timerlat -T 20 --on-threshold trace
> --on-threshold shell,command=”grep ipi_send timerlat_trace.txt”
> --on-threshold signal,num=2,pid=parent
>
> This will save a trace with the default filename “timerlat_trace.txt”, print its
> lines that contain the text “ipi_send” on standard output, and send signal 2
> (SIGINT) to the parent process.
>
> Performance Considerations:
>
> For time-sensitive actions, it is recommended to run **rtla timerlat** with BPF
> support and RT priority. Note that due to implementational limitations, actions
> might be delayed up to one second after tracing is stopped if BPF mode is not
> available or disabled.

**--on-end** *action*

> Defines an action to be executed at the end of **rtla timerlat** tracing.
>
> Multiple --on-end actions can be specified, and they will be executed in the order
> they are provided. If any action fails, subsequent actions in the list will not be
> executed.
>
> See the documentation for **--on-threshold** for the list of supported actions, with
> the exception that *continue* has no effect.
>
> Example:
>
> $ rtla timerlat -d 5s --on-end trace
>
> This runs rtla timerlat with default options and save trace output at the end.

**-q**, **--quiet**

> Print only a summary at the end of the session.

**-c**, **--cpus** *cpu-list*

> Set the osnoise tracer to run the sample threads in the cpu-list.

**-H**, **--house-keeping** *cpu-list*

> Run rtla control threads only on the given cpu-list.

**-d**, **--duration** *time[s|m|h|d]*

> Set the duration of the session.

**-D**, **--debug**

> Print debug info.

**-e**, **--event** *sys:event*

> Enable an event in the trace (**-t**) session. The argument can be a specific event, e.g., **-e** *sched:sched_switch*, or all events of a system group, e.g., **-e** *sched*. Multiple **-e** are allowed. It is only active when **-t** or **-a** are set.

**--filter** *<filter>*

> Filter the previous **-e** *sys:event* event with *<filter>*. For further information about event filtering see <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/trace/events.html#event-filtering>.

**--trigger** *<trigger>*
:   Enable a trace event trigger to the previous **-e** *sys:event*.
    If the *hist:* trigger is activated, the output histogram will be automatically saved to a file named *system_event_hist.txt*.
    For example, the command:

    rtla <command> <mode> -t -e osnoise:irq_noise --trigger=”hist:key=desc,duration/1000:sort=desc,duration/1000:vals=hitcount”

    Will automatically save the content of the histogram associated to *osnoise:irq_noise* event in *osnoise_irq_noise_hist.txt*.

    For further information about event trigger see <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/trace/events.html#event-triggers>.

**-P**, **--priority** *o:prio|r:prio|f:prio|d:runtime:period*

> Set scheduling parameters to the osnoise tracer threads, the format to set the priority are:
>
> - *o:prio* - use SCHED_OTHER with *prio*;
> - *r:prio* - use SCHED_RR with *prio*;
> - *f:prio* - use SCHED_FIFO with *prio*;
> - *d:runtime[us|ms|s]:period[us|ms|s]* - use SCHED_DEADLINE with *runtime* and *period* in nanoseconds.

**-C**, **--cgroup**[*=cgroup*]

> Set a *cgroup* to the tracer’s threads. If the **-C** option is passed without arguments, the tracer’s thread will inherit **rtla**’s *cgroup*. Otherwise, the threads will be placed on the *cgroup* passed to the option.

**--warm-up** *s*

> After starting the workload, let it run for *s* seconds before starting collecting the data, allowing the system to warm-up. Statistical data generated during warm-up is discarded.

**--trace-buffer-size** *kB*
:   Set the per-cpu trace buffer size in kB for the tracing output.

**-h**, **--help**

> Print help menu.

**--dump-tasks**

> prints the task running on all CPUs if stop conditions are met (depends on !--no-aa)

**--no-aa**

> disable auto-analysis, reducing rtla timerlat cpu usage

**--aa-only** *us*

> Set stop tracing conditions and run without collecting and displaying statistics.
> Print the auto-analysis if the system hits the stop tracing condition. This option
> is useful to reduce rtla timerlat CPU, enabling the debug without the overhead of
> collecting the statistics.

### EXAMPLE

In the example below, the timerlat tracer is dispatched in cpus *1-23* in the
automatic trace mode, instructing the tracer to stop if a *40 us* latency or
higher is found:

```

  Max timerlat IRQ latency from idle: 17.48 us in cpu 4
Saving trace to timerlat_trace.txt
```

In this case, the major factor was the delay suffered by the *IRQ handler*
that handles **timerlat** wakeup: *65.52%*. This can be caused by the
current thread masking interrupts, which can be seen in the blocking
thread stacktrace: the current thread (*objtool:49256*) disabled interrupts
via *raw spin lock* operations inside mem cgroup, while doing write
syscall in a btrfs file system.

The raw trace is saved in the **timerlat_trace.txt** file for further analysis.

Note that **rtla timerlat** was dispatched without changing *timerlat* tracer
threads’ priority. That is generally not needed because these threads have
priority *FIFO:95* by default, which is a common priority used by real-time
kernel developers to analyze scheduling delays.
