# CephFS Snapshots

CephFS snapshots create an immutable view of the file system at the point in
time they are taken. CephFS snapshots are managed in a special hidden
subdirectory named `.snap`. Snapshots are created using `mkdir` inside the
`.snap` directory.

Snapshots can be exposed with different names by changing the following client
configurations:

- `snapdirname` which is a mount option for kernel clients
- `client_snapdir` which is a mount option for ceph-fuse.

## Snapshot Creation

The CephFS snapshot feature is enabled by default on new file systems. To
enable the CephFS snapshot feature on existing file systems, use the command
below.

```bash
$ ceph fs set <fs_name> allow_new_snaps true
```

When snapshots are enabled, all directories in CephFS will have a special
`.snap` directory. (You may configure a different name with the client’s
`snapdir` setting if you wish.) To create a CephFS snapshot, create a
subdirectory under `.snap` with a name of your choice. For example, to
create a snapshot on directory `/file1/`, run the command `mkdir
/file1/.snap/snapshot-name`:

```bash
$ touch file1
$ cd .snap
$ mkdir my_snapshot
```

## Using Snapshots to Recover Data

Snapshots can also be used to recover deleted files:

- `create a file1 and create snapshot snap1`

```bash
$ touch /mnt/cephfs/file1
$ cd .snap
$ mkdir snap1
```

- `create a file2 and create snapshot snap2`

```bash
$ touch /mnt/cephfs/file2
$ cd .snap
$ mkdir snap2
```

- `delete file1 and create a new snapshot snap3`

```bash
$ rm /mnt/cephfs/file1
$ cd .snap
$ mkdir snap3
```

- `recover file1 using snapshot snap2 using cp command`

```bash
$ cd .snap
$ cd snap2
$ cp file1 /mnt/cephfs/
```

## Snapshot Deletion

Snapshots are deleted by running `rmdir` on the `.snap` directory that they
are rooted in. (Attempts to delete a directory that roots the snapshots will
fail. You must delete the snapshots first.)

```bash
$ cd .snap
$ rmdir my_snapshot
```
