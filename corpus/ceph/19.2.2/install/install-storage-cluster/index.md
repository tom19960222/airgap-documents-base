# Install Ceph Storage Cluster

This guide describes installing Ceph packages manually. This procedure
is only for users who are not installing with a deployment tool such as
`cephadm`, `chef`, `juju`, etc.

## Installing with APT

Once you have added either release or development packages to APT, you should
update APT’s database and install Ceph:

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ceph ceph-mds
```

## Installing with RPM

To install Ceph with RPMs, execute the following steps:

1. Install `yum-plugin-priorities`.

   ```
   sudo yum install yum-plugin-priorities
   ```
2. Ensure `/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/priorities.conf` exists.
3. Ensure `priorities.conf` enables the plugin.

   ```
   [main]
   enabled = 1
   ```
4. Ensure your YUM `ceph.repo` entry includes `priority=2`. See
   [Get Packages](../get-packages.md) for details:

   ```
   [ceph]
   name=Ceph packages for $basearch
   baseurl=https://download.ceph.com/rpm-{ceph-release}/{distro}/$basearch
   enabled=1
   priority=2
   gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=https://download.ceph.com/keys/release.asc

   [ceph-noarch]
   name=Ceph noarch packages
   baseurl=https://download.ceph.com/rpm-{ceph-release}/{distro}/noarch
   enabled=1
   priority=2
   gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=https://download.ceph.com/keys/release.asc

   [ceph-source]
   name=Ceph source packages
   baseurl=https://download.ceph.com/rpm-{ceph-release}/{distro}/SRPMS
   enabled=0
   priority=2
   gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=https://download.ceph.com/keys/release.asc
   ```
5. Install pre-requisite packages:

   ```
   sudo yum install snappy gdisk python-argparse gperftools-libs
   ```

Once you have added either release or development packages, or added a
`ceph.repo` file to `/etc/yum.repos.d`, you can install Ceph packages.

```
sudo yum install ceph
```

## Installing a Build

If you build Ceph from source code, you may install Ceph in user space
by executing the following:

```
sudo ninja install
```

If you install Ceph locally, `ninja` will place the executables in
`usr/local/bin`. You may add the Ceph configuration file to the
`usr/local/bin` directory to run Ceph from a single directory.
