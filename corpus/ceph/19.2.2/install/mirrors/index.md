You can replace all download.ceph.com URLs with any of the mirrors, for example:

- <http://download.ceph.com/rpm-hammer/>

Change this to:

- <http://eu.ceph.com/tarballs/>
- <http://eu.ceph.com/debian-hammer/>

## Mirroring

You can easily mirror Ceph yourself using a Bash script and rsync. An easy-to-use
script can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/tree/master/mirroring).

When mirroring Ceph, please keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Choose a mirror close to you
- Do not sync in a interval shorter than 3 hours
- Avoid syncing at minute 0 of the hour, use something between 0 and 59

## Becoming a mirror

If you want to provide a public mirror for other users of Ceph you can opt to
become a official mirror.

To make sure all mirrors meet the same standards some requirements have been
set for all mirrors. These can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/tree/master/mirroring).

If you want to apply for an official mirror, please contact the ceph-users mailinglist.
