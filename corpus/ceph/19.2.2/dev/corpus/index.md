# Corpus structure

ceph.git/ceph-object-corpus is a submodule.:

```
bin/   # misc scripts
archive/$version/objects/$type/$hash  # a sample of encoded objects from a specific version
```

You can also mark known or deliberate incompatibilities between versions with:

```
archive/$version/forward_incompat/$type
```

The presence of a file indicates that new versions of code cannot
decode old objects across that `$version` (this is normally the case).

## How to generate an object corpus

We can generate an object corpus for a particular version of ceph using the
script of `script/gen-corpus.sh`, or by following the instructions below:

1. Checkout a clean repo (best not to do this where you normally work):

   ```shell
   git clone ceph.git
   cd ceph
   git submodule update --init --recursive --progress
   ```
2. Build with flag to dump objects to `/tmp/foo`:

   ```shell
   rm -rf /tmp/foo ; mkdir /tmp/foo
   do_cmake.sh -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-DENCODE_DUMP_PATH=/tmp/foo"
   cd build
   make
   ```
3. Start via vstart:

   ```shell
   cd build
   MON=3 MGR=2 OSD=3 MDS=3 RGW=1 ../src/vstart.sh -n -x
   ```
4. Use as much functionality of the cluster as you can, to exercise as many object encoder methods as possible:

   ```shell
   bin/ceph osd pool create mypool
   bin/rados -p mypool bench 10 write -b 123
   bin/ceph osd out 0
   bin/ceph osd in 0
   bin/init-ceph restart osd.1
   for f in ../qa/workunits/cls/*.sh ; do PATH="bin:$PATH" $f ; done
   PATH="bin:$PATH" ../qa/workunits/rados/test.sh
   bin/ceph_test_librbd
   bin/ceph_test_libcephfs
   bin/init-ceph restart mds.a
   ../qa/workunits/rgw/run-s3tests.sh
   ```
5. Stop:

   ```shell
   ../src/stop.sh
   ```
6. Import the corpus (this will take a few minutes):

   ```shell
   ../src/test/encoding/import.sh /tmp/foo `bin/ceph-dencoder version` ../ceph-object-corpus/archive
   ../src/test/encoding/import-generated.sh ../ceph-object-corpus/archive
   ```
7. Prune it! There will be a bazillion copies of various objects, and we only want a representative sample.:

   ```shell
   pushd ../ceph-object-corpus
   bin/prune-archive.sh
   popd
   ```
8. Verify the tests pass:

   ```shell
   ctest -R readable.sh
   ```
9. Commit it to the corpus repo and push:

   ```shell
   pushd ../ceph-object-corpus
   git checkout -b wip-new
   git add archive/`../build/bin/ceph-dencoder version`
   git commit -m `../build/bin/ceph-dencoder version`
   git remote add cc git@github.com:ceph/ceph-object-corpus.git
   git push cc wip-new
   popd
   ```
10. Go test it out:

    ```shell
    cd my/regular/tree
    cd ceph-object-corpus
    git fetch origin
    git checkout wip-new
    cd ../build
    ctest -R readable.sh
    ```
11. If everything looks good, update the submodule master branch, and commit the submodule in ceph.git.
