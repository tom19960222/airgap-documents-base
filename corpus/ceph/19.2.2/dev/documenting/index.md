# Documenting Ceph

## User documentation

The documentation on docs.ceph.com is generated from the reStructuredText
sources in `/doc/` in the Ceph git repository.

Please make sure that your changes are written in a way that is intended
for end users of the software, unless you are making additions in
`/doc/dev/`, which is the section for developers.

All pull requests that modify user-facing functionality must
include corresponding updates to documentation: see
[Submitting Patches](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/blob/master/SubmittingPatches.rst) for more detail.

Check your .rst syntax is working as expected by using the “View”
button in the github user interface when looking at a diff on
an .rst file, or build the docs locally using the `admin/build-doc`
script.

For more information about the Ceph documentation, see
[Documenting Ceph](../../start/documenting-ceph/index.md).

## Code Documentation

C and C++ can be documented with [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/), using the subset of Doxygen
markup supported by [Breathe](https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe).

The general format for function documentation is

```c
/**
 * Short description
 *
 * Detailed description when necessary
 *
 * preconditions, postconditions, warnings, bugs or other notes
 *
 * parameter reference
 * return value (if non-void)
 */
```

This should be in the header where the function is declared, and
functions should be grouped into logical categories. The [librados C
API](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/blob/master/src/include/rados/librados.h) provides a complete example. It is pulled into Sphinx by
[librados.rst](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/raw/master/doc/rados/api/librados.rst), which is rendered at [Librados (C)](../../rados/api/librados/index.md).

To generate the doxygen documentation in HTML format use:

```
# cmake --build . --target doxygen
```

HTML output will be under: `build-doc/doxygen/html`

## Drawing diagrams

### Graphviz

You can use [Graphviz](http://graphviz.org/), as explained in the [Graphviz extension documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/graphviz.html).

digraph "example" {
foo -> bar;
bar -> baz;
bar -> th
}

Most of the time, you’ll want to put the actual DOT source in a
separate file, like this:

```
.. graphviz:: myfile.dot
```

See the [Dot User’s Manual](https://www.graphviz.org/pdf/dotguide.pdf) by
Emden R. Gansner, Eleftherios Koutsofios, and Stephen North for examples of
digraphs. This is especially useful if this is your first time encountering
GraphViz.

### Ditaa

You can use [Ditaa](http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/):

### Blockdiag

If a use arises, we can integrate [Blockdiag](http://blockdiag.com/en/). It is a Graphviz-style
declarative language for drawing things, and includes:

- [block diagrams](http://blockdiag.com/en/blockdiag/): boxes and arrows (automatic layout, as opposed to
  [Ditaa](http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/))
- [sequence diagrams](http://blockdiag.com/en/seqdiag/index.html): timelines and messages between them
- [activity diagrams](http://blockdiag.com/en/actdiag/index.html): subsystems and activities in them
- [network diagrams](http://blockdiag.com/en/nwdiag/): hosts, LANs, IP addresses etc (with [Cisco
  icons](https://pypi.org/project/blockdiagcontrib-cisco/) if wanted)

### Inkscape

You can use Inkscape to generate scalable vector graphics.
<https://inkscape.org/en/> for restructuredText documents.

If you generate diagrams with Inkscape, you should
commit both the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file and export a
Portable Network Graphic (PNG) file. Reference the PNG file.

By committing the SVG file, others will be able to update the
SVG diagrams using Inkscape.

HTML5 will support SVG inline.
