# Building Ceph Documentation

Ceph utilizes Python’s Sphinx documentation tool. For details on
the Sphinx documentation tool, refer to [The Sphinx Documentation Tool](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

To build the Ceph documentation set, you must:

1. Clone the Ceph repository
2. Install the required tools
3. Build the documents
4. Demo the documents (Optional)

## Clone the Ceph Repository

To clone the Ceph repository, you must have `git` installed
on your local host. To install `git`, execute:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

To clone the Ceph repository, execute:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/ceph/ceph
```

You should have a full copy of the Ceph repository.

## Install the Required Tools

To build the Ceph documentation, some dependencies are required.
To know what packages are needed, you can launch this command:

```bash
cd ceph
admin/build-doc
```

If dependencies are missing, the command above will fail
with a message that suggests you a command to install all
missing dependencies.

## Build the Documents

Once you have installed all the dependencies, execute the build (the
same command as above):

```bash
cd ceph
admin/build-doc
```

Once you build the documentation set, you may navigate to the source directory to view it:

```bash
cd build-doc/output
```

There should be an `html` directory and a `man` directory containing documentation
in HTML and manpage formats respectively.

`admin/build-doc` takes a long time to prepare the environment and build the document.
But you can just rebuild the document on changes using:

```bash
admin/build-doc livehtml
```

This feature uses `sphinx-autobuild` under the hood. You can also pass options to it. For
instance, to open the browser after building the documentation:

```bash
admin/build-doc livehtml -- --open-browser
```

Please see [sphinx-autobuild](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild/) for more details.

## Demo the Documents

Once you build the documentation, as described above, you can demo the rendered documents
by running `serve-doc`:

```bash
cd ceph
admin/serve-doc
```

This will serve the `build-doc/output/html` directory over port 8080 via
Python’s `SimpleHTTPServer` module.
