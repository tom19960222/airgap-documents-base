# ceph-osd -- ceph object storage daemon

## Synopsis

**ceph-osd** -i *osdnum* [ --osd-data *datapath* ] [ --osd-journal
*journal* ] [ --mkfs ] [ --mkjournal ] [--flush-journal] [--check-allows-journal] [--check-wants-journal] [--check-needs-journal] [ --mkkey ] [ --osdspec-affinity ]

## Description

**ceph-osd** is the **o**bject **s**torage **d**aemon for the Ceph
distributed file system. It manages data on local storage with redundancy and
provides access to that data over the network.

For Filestore-backed clusters, the argument of the `--osd-data datapath`
option (which is `datapath` in this example) should be a directory on an XFS
file system where the object data resides. The journal is optional. The journal
improves performance only when it resides on a different disk than the disk
specified by `datapath` . The storage medium on which the journal is stored
should be a low-latency medium (ideally, an SSD device).

## Options

-f, --foreground
:   Foreground: do not daemonize after startup (run in foreground). Do
    not generate a pid file. Useful when run via [ceph-run](../ceph-run/index.md)(8).

-d
:   Debug mode: like `-f`, but also send all log output to stderr.

--setuser userorgid
:   Set uid after starting. If a username is specified, the user
    record is looked up to get a uid and a gid, and the gid is also set
    as well, unless --setgroup is also specified.

--setgroup grouporgid
:   Set gid after starting. If a group name is specified the group
    record is looked up to get a gid.

--osd-data osddata
:   Use object store at *osddata*.

--osd-journal journal
:   Journal updates to *journal*.

--check-wants-journal
:   Check whether a journal is desired.

--check-allows-journal
:   Check whether a journal is allowed.

--check-needs-journal
:   Check whether a journal is required.

--mkfs
:   Create an empty object repository. This also initializes the journal
    (if one is defined).

--mkkey
:   Generate a new secret key. This is normally used in combination
    with `--mkfs` as it is more convenient than generating a key by
    hand with [ceph-authtool](../ceph-authtool/index.md)(8).

--mkjournal
:   Create a new journal file to match an existing object repository.
    This is useful if the journal device or file is wiped out due to a
    disk or file system failure.

--flush-journal
:   Flush the journal to permanent store. This runs in the foreground
    so you know when it’s completed. This can be useful if you want to
    resize the journal or need to otherwise destroy it: this guarantees
    you won’t lose data.

--get-cluster-fsid
:   Print the cluster fsid (uuid) and exit.

--get-osd-fsid
:   Print the OSD’s fsid and exit. The OSD’s uuid is generated at
    --mkfs time and is thus unique to a particular instantiation of
    this OSD.

--get-journal-fsid
:   Print the journal’s uuid. The journal fsid is set to match the OSD
    fsid at --mkfs time.

-c ceph.conf, --conf=ceph.conf
:   Use *ceph.conf* configuration file instead of the default
    `/etc/ceph/ceph.conf` for runtime configuration options.

-m monaddress[:port]
:   Connect to specified monitor (instead of looking through
    `ceph.conf`).

--osdspec-affinity
:   Set an affinity to a certain OSDSpec.
    This option can only be used in conjunction with --mkfs.

## Availability

**ceph-osd** is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source, distributed storage system. Please refer to
the Ceph documentation at <https://docs.ceph.com> for more information.
