# ceph-mon -- ceph monitor daemon

## Synopsis

**ceph-mon** -i *monid* [ --mon-data *mondatapath* ]

## Description

**ceph-mon** is the cluster monitor daemon for the Ceph distributed
file system. One or more instances of **ceph-mon** form a Paxos
part-time parliament cluster that provides extremely reliable and
durable storage of cluster membership, configuration, and state.

The *mondatapath* refers to a directory on a local file system storing
monitor data. It is normally specified via the `mon data` option in
the configuration file.

## Options

-f, --foreground
:   Foreground: do not daemonize after startup (run in foreground). Do
    not generate a pid file. Useful when run via [ceph-run](../ceph-run/index.md)(8).

-d
:   Debug mode: like `-f`, but also send all log output to stderr.

--setuser userorgid
:   Set uid after starting. If a username is specified, the user
    record is looked up to get a uid and a gid, and the gid is also set
    as well, unless --setgroup is also specified.

--setgroup grouporgid
:   Set gid after starting. If a group name is specified the group
    record is looked up to get a gid.

-c ceph.conf, --conf=ceph.conf
:   Use *ceph.conf* configuration file instead of the default
    `/etc/ceph/ceph.conf` to determine monitor addresses during
    startup.

--mkfs
:   Initialize the `mon data` directory with seed information to form
    and initial ceph file system or to join an existing monitor
    cluster. Three pieces of information must be provided:

    - The cluster fsid. This can come from a monmap (`--monmap <path>`) or
      explicitly via `--fsid <uuid>`.
    - A list of monitors and their addresses. This list of monitors
      can come from a monmap (`--monmap <path>`), the `mon host`
      configuration value (in *ceph.conf* or via `-m
      host1,host2,...`), or (for backward compatibility) the deprecated `mon addr` lines in *ceph.conf*. If this
      monitor is to be part of the initial monitor quorum for a new
      Ceph cluster, then it must be included in the initial list,
      matching either the name or address of a monitor in the list.
      When matching by address, either the `public addr` or `public
      subnet` options may be used.
    - The monitor secret key `mon.`. This must be included in the
      keyring provided via `--keyring <path>`.

--keyring
:   Specify a keyring for use with `--mkfs`.

--no-config-file
:   Signal that we don’t want to rely on a *ceph.conf*, either user provided
    or the default, to run the daemon. This will entail providing all
    necessary options to the daemon as arguments.

## Availability

**ceph-mon** is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source, distributed storage system. Please refer
to the Ceph documentation at <https://docs.ceph.com> for more
information.
