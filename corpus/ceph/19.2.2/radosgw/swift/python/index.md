# Python Swift Examples

## Create a Connection

This creates a connection so that you can interact with the server:

```python
import swiftclient
user = 'account_name:username'
key = 'your_api_key'

conn = swiftclient.Connection(
        user=user,
        key=key,
        authurl='https://objects.dreamhost.com/auth',
)
```

## Create a Container

This creates a new container called `my-new-container`:

```python
container_name = 'my-new-container'
conn.put_container(container_name)
```

## Create an Object

This creates a file `hello.txt` from the file named `my_hello.txt`:

```python
with open('hello.txt', 'r') as hello_file:
        conn.put_object(container_name, 'hello.txt',
                                        contents= hello_file.read(),
                                        content_type='text/plain')
```

## List Owned Containers

This gets a list of containers that you own, and prints out the container name:

```python
for container in conn.get_account()[1]:
        print(container['name'])
```

The output will look something like this:

```
mahbuckat1
mahbuckat2
mahbuckat3
```

## List a Container’s Content

This gets a list of objects in the container, and prints out each
object’s name, the file size, and last modified date:

```python
for data in conn.get_container(container_name)[1]:
        print('{0}\t{1}\t{2}'.format(data['name'], data['bytes'], data['last_modified']))
```

The output will look something like this:

```
myphoto1.jpg 251262  2011-08-08T21:35:48.000Z
myphoto2.jpg 262518  2011-08-08T21:38:01.000Z
```

## Retrieve an Object

This downloads the object `hello.txt` and saves it in
`./my_hello.txt`:

```python
obj_tuple = conn.get_object(container_name, 'hello.txt')
with open('my_hello.txt', 'w') as my_hello:
        my_hello.write(obj_tuple[1])
```

## Delete an Object

This deletes the object `hello.txt`:

```python
conn.delete_object(container_name, 'hello.txt')
```

## Delete a Container

> **Note:**
>
> The container must be empty! Otherwise the request won’t work!

```python
conn.delete_container(container_name)
```
