# S3 Bucket Notifications Compatibility

Ceph’s [Bucket Notifications](../notifications.md) API follows [AWS S3 Bucket Notifications API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html). However, some differences exist, as listed below.

> **Note:**
>
> Compatibility is different depending on which of the above mechanism is used

## Supported Destination

AWS supports: **SNS**, **SQS** and **Lambda** as possible destinations (AWS internal destinations).
Currently, we support: **HTTP/S**, **Kafka** and **AMQP**.

We are using the **SNS** ARNs to represent the **HTTP/S**, **Kafka** and **AMQP** destinations.

## Notification Configuration XML

Following tags (and the tags inside them) are not supported:

| Tag | Remaks |
| --- | --- |
| `<QueueConfiguration>` | not needed, we treat all destinations as SNS |
| `<CloudFunctionConfiguration>` | not needed, we treat all destinations as SNS |

## REST API Extension

Ceph’s bucket notification API has the following extensions:

- Deletion of a specific notification, or all notifications on a bucket, using the `DELETE` verb

> - In S3, all notifications are deleted when the bucket is deleted, or when an empty notification is set on the bucket

- Getting the information on a specific notification (when more than one exists on a bucket)

  - In S3, it is only possible to fetch all notifications on a bucket
- In addition to filtering based on prefix/suffix of object keys we support:

  - Filtering based on regular expression matching
  - Filtering based on metadata attributes attached to the object
  - Filtering based on object tags
- Each one of the additional filters extends the S3 API and using it will require extension of the client SDK (unless you are using plain HTTP).
- Filtering overlapping is allowed, so that same event could be sent as different notification

## Unsupported Fields in the Event Record

The records sent for bucket notification follows the format described in: [Event Message Structure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/notification-content-structure.html).
However, the `requestParameters.sourceIPAddress` field will be sent empty.

## Event Types

| Event | Note |
| --- | --- |
| `s3:ObjectCreated:*` | Supported |
| `s3:ObjectCreated:Put` | Supported |
| `s3:ObjectCreated:Post` | Supported |
| `s3:ObjectCreated:Copy` | Supported |
| `s3:ObjectCreated:CompleteMultipartUpload` | Supported |
| `s3:ObjectRemoved:*` | Supported |
| `s3:ObjectRemoved:Delete` | Supported |
| `s3:ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated` | Supported |
| `s3:ObjectLifecycle:Expiration:Current` | Ceph extension |
| `s3:ObjectLifecycle:Expiration:NonCurrent` | Ceph extension |
| `s3:ObjectLifecycle:Expiration:DeleteMarker` | Ceph extension |
| `s3:ObjectLifecycle:Expiration:AbortMultipartUpload` | Ceph extension |
| `s3:ObjectLifecycle:Transition:Current` | Ceph extension |
| `s3:ObjectLifecycle:Transition:NonCurrent` | Ceph extension |
| `s3:LifecycleExpiration:*` | Supported. Equivalent to s3:LifecycleExpiration:Delete, s3:LifecycleExpiration:DeleteMarkerCreated |
| `s3:LifecycleExpiration:Delete` | Supported. Equivalent to s3:ObjectLifecycle:Expiration:Current |
| `s3:LifecycleExpiration:DeleteMarkerCreated` | Supported. Equivalent to s3:ObjectLifecycle:Expiration:DeleteMarker |
| `s3:LifecycleTransition` | Supported. Equivalent to s3:ObjectLifecycle:Transition:Current |
| `s3:ObjectSynced:*` | Ceph extension |
| `s3:ObjectSynced:Create` | Ceph Extension |
| `s3:ObjectSynced:Delete` | Ceph extension |
| `s3:ObjectSynced:DeletionMarkerCreated` | Defined, Ceph extension (not generated) |
| `s3:Replication:*` | Supported. Equivalent to s3:ObjectSynced:Create, s3:ObjectSynced:Delete |
| `s3:Replication:Create` | Supported. Equivalent to s3:ObjectSynced:Create |
| `s3:Replication:Delete` | Supported. Equivalent to s3:ObjectSynced:Delete |
| `s3:Replication:DeletionMarkerCreated` | Defined, Supported (not generated) |
| `s3:ObjectRestore:Post` | Not applicable |
| `s3:ObjectRestore:Complete` | Not applicable |
| `s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject` | Not applicable |

> **Note:**
>
> The `s3:ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated` event presents information on the latest version of the object

> **Note:**
>
> In case of multipart upload, an `ObjectCreated:CompleteMultipartUpload` notification will be sent at the end of the process.

> **Note:**
>
> The `s3:ObjectSynced:Create` event is sent when an object successfully syncs to a zone. It must be explicitly set for each zone.

## Topic Configuration

In the case of bucket notifications, the topics management API will be derived from [AWS Simple Notification Service API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Operations.html).
Note that most of the API is not applicable to Ceph, and only the following actions are implemented:

> - `CreateTopic`
> - `DeleteTopic`
> - `ListTopics`

We also have the following extensions to topic configuration:

> - In `GetTopic` we allow fetching a specific topic, instead of all user topics
> - In `CreateTopic`
>
> > - we allow setting endpoint attributes
> > - we allow setting opaque data that will be sent to the endpoint in the notification
