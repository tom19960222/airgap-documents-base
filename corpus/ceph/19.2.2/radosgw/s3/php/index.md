# PHP S3 Examples

## Installing AWS PHP SDK

This installs AWS PHP SDK using composer (see [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/) how to install composer).

```bash
$ composer install aws/aws-sdk-php
```

## Creating a Connection

This creates a connection so that you can interact with the server.

> **Note:**
>
> The client initialization requires a region so we use `''`.

```php
<?php

use Aws\S3\S3Client;

define('AWS_KEY', 'place access key here');
define('AWS_SECRET_KEY', 'place secret key here');
$ENDPOINT = 'http://objects.dreamhost.com';

// require the amazon sdk from your composer vendor dir
require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

// Instantiate the S3 class and point it at the desired host
$client = new S3Client([
    'region' => '',
    'version' => '2006-03-01',
    'endpoint' => $ENDPOINT,
    'credentials' => [
        'key' => AWS_KEY,
        'secret' => AWS_SECRET_KEY
    ],
    // Set the S3 class to use objects.dreamhost.com/bucket
    // instead of bucket.objects.dreamhost.com
    'use_path_style_endpoint' => true
]);
```

## Listing Owned Buckets

This gets a `AWS\Result` instance that is more convenient to visit using array access way.
This also prints out the bucket name and creation date of each bucket.

```php
<?php
$listResponse = $client->listBuckets();
$buckets = $listResponse['Buckets'];
foreach ($buckets as $bucket) {
    echo $bucket['Name'] . "\t" . $bucket['CreationDate'] . "\n";
}
```

The output will look something like this:

```
mahbuckat1   2011-04-21T18:05:39.000Z
mahbuckat2   2011-04-21T18:05:48.000Z
mahbuckat3   2011-04-21T18:07:18.000Z
```

## Creating a Bucket

This creates a new bucket called `my-new-bucket` and returns a
`AWS\Result` object.

```php
<?php
$client->createBucket(['Bucket' => 'my-new-bucket']);
```

## List a Bucket’s Content

This gets a `AWS\Result` instance that is more convenient to visit using array access way.
This then prints out each object’s name, the file size, and last modified date.

```php
<?php
$objectsListResponse = $client->listObjects(['Bucket' => $bucketname]);
$objects = $objectsListResponse['Contents'] ?? [];
foreach ($objects as $object) {
    echo $object['Key'] . "\t" . $object['Size'] . "\t" . $object['LastModified'] . "\n";
}
```

> **Note:**
>
> If there are more than 1000 objects in this bucket,
> you need to check $objectsListResponse[‘isTruncated’]
> and run again with the name of the last key listed.
> Keep doing this until isTruncated is not true.

The output will look something like this if the bucket has some files:

```
myphoto1.jpg 251262  2011-08-08T21:35:48.000Z
myphoto2.jpg 262518  2011-08-08T21:38:01.000Z
```

## Deleting a Bucket

This deletes the bucket called `my-old-bucket` and returns a
`AWS\Result` object

> **Note:**
>
> The Bucket must be empty! Otherwise it won’t work!

```php
<?php
$client->deleteBucket(['Bucket' => 'my-old-bucket']);
```

## Creating an Object

This creates an object `hello.txt` with the string `"Hello World!"`

```php
<?php
$client->putObject([
    'Bucket' => 'my-bucket-name',
    'Key' => 'hello.txt',
    'Body' => "Hello World!"
]);
```

## Change an Object’s ACL

This makes the object `hello.txt` to be publicly readable and
`secret_plans.txt` to be private.

```php
<?php
$client->putObjectAcl([
    'Bucket' => 'my-bucket-name',
    'Key' => 'hello.txt',
    'ACL' => 'public-read'
]);
$client->putObjectAcl([
    'Bucket' => 'my-bucket-name',
    'Key' => 'secret_plans.txt',
    'ACL' => 'private'
]);
```

## Delete an Object

This deletes the object `goodbye.txt`

```php
<?php
$client->deleteObject(['Bucket' => 'my-bucket-name', 'Key' => 'goodbye.txt']);
```

## Download an Object (to a file)

This downloads the object `poetry.pdf` and saves it in
`/home/larry/documents/`

```php
<?php
$object = $client->getObject(['Bucket' => 'my-bucket-name', 'Key' => 'poetry.pdf']);
file_put_contents('/home/larry/documents/poetry.pdf', $object['Body']->getContents());
```

## Generate Object Download URLs (signed and unsigned)

This generates an unsigned download URL for `hello.txt`.
This works because we made `hello.txt` public by setting
the ACL above. This then generates a signed download URL
for `secret_plans.txt` that will work for 1 hour.
Signed download URLs will work for the time period even
if the object is private (when the time period is up,
the URL will stop working).

```php
<?php
$hello_url = $client->getObjectUrl('my-bucket-name', 'hello.txt');
echo $hello_url."\n";

$secret_plans_cmd = $client->getCommand('GetObject', ['Bucket' => 'my-bucket-name', 'Key' => 'secret_plans.txt']);
$request = $client->createPresignedRequest($secret_plans_cmd, '+1 hour');
echo $request->getUri()."\n";
```

The output of this will look something like:

```
http://objects.dreamhost.com/my-bucket-name/hello.txt
http://objects.dreamhost.com/my-bucket-name/secret_plans.txt?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=sandboxAccessKey%2F20190116%2F%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20190116T125520Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=61921f07c73d7695e47a2192cf55ae030f34c44c512b2160bb5a936b2b48d923
```
