# OpenStack Barbican Integration

OpenStack [Barbican](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Barbican) can be used as a secure key management service for
[Server-Side Encryption](../encryption.md).

![../../_images/rgw-encryption-barbican.png](../../_images/rgw-encryption-barbican.png)

1. [Configure Keystone](index.md#configure-keystone)
2. [Create a Keystone user](index.md#create-a-keystone-user)
3. [Configure the Ceph Object Gateway](index.md#configure-the-ceph-object-gateway)
4. [Create a key in Barbican](index.md#create-a-key-in-barbican)

## Configure Keystone

Barbican depends on Keystone for authorization and access control of its keys.

See [OpenStack Keystone Integration](../keystone.md).

## Create a Keystone user

Create a new user that will be used by the Ceph Object Gateway to retrieve
keys.

For example:

```
user = rgwcrypt-user
pass = rgwcrypt-password
tenant = rgwcrypt
```

See OpenStack documentation for [Manage projects, users, and roles](https://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide/cli-manage-projects-users-and-roles.html#create-a-user).

## Create a key in Barbican

See Barbican documentation for [How to Create a Secret](https://developer.openstack.org/api-guide/key-manager/secrets.html#how-to-create-a-secret). Requests to
Barbican must include a valid Keystone token in the `X-Auth-Token` header.

> **Note:**
>
> Server-side encryption keys must be 256-bit long and base64 encoded.

Example request:

```
POST /v1/secrets HTTP/1.1
Host: barbican.example.com:9311
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: 7f7d588dd29b44df983bc961a6b73a10
Content-Length: 299

{
    "name": "my-key",
    "expiration": "2016-12-28T19:14:44.180394",
    "algorithm": "aes",
    "bit_length": 256,
    "mode": "cbc",
    "payload": "6b+WOZ1T3cqZMxgThRcXAQBrS5mXKdDUphvpxptl9/4=",
    "payload_content_type": "application/octet-stream",
    "payload_content_encoding": "base64"
}
```

Response:

```
{"secret_ref": "http://barbican.example.com:9311/v1/secrets/d1e7ef3b-f841-4b7c-90b2-b7d90ca2d723"}
```

In the response, `d1e7ef3b-f841-4b7c-90b2-b7d90ca2d723` is the key id that
can be used in any [SSE-KMS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html) request.

This newly created key is not accessible by user `rgwcrypt-user`. This
privilege must be added with an ACL. See [How to Set/Replace ACL](https://developer.openstack.org/api-guide/key-manager/acls.html#how-to-set-replace-acl) for more
details.

Example request (assuming that the Keystone id of `rgwcrypt-user` is
`906aa90bd8a946c89cdff80d0869460f`):

```
PUT /v1/secrets/d1e7ef3b-f841-4b7c-90b2-b7d90ca2d723/acl HTTP/1.1
Host: barbican.example.com:9311
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: 7f7d588dd29b44df983bc961a6b73a10
Content-Length: 101

{
    "read":{
    "users":[ "906aa90bd8a946c89cdff80d0869460f" ],
    "project-access": true
    }
}
```

Response:

```
{"acl_ref": "http://barbican.example.com:9311/v1/secrets/d1e7ef3b-f841-4b7c-90b2-b7d90ca2d723/acl"}
```

## Configure the Ceph Object Gateway

Edit the Ceph configuration file to enable Barbican as a KMS and add information
about the Barbican server and Keystone user:

```
rgw crypt s3 kms backend = barbican
rgw barbican url = http://barbican.example.com:9311
rgw keystone barbican user = rgwcrypt-user
rgw keystone barbican password = rgwcrypt-password
```

When using Keystone API version 2:

```
rgw keystone barbican tenant = rgwcrypt
```

When using API version 3:

```
rgw keystone barbican project
rgw keystone barbican domain
```
