# RBD Replay

RBD Replay is a set of tools for capturing and replaying RADOS Block Device
(RBD) workloads. To capture an RBD workload, `lttng-tools` must be installed
on the client, and `librbd` on the client must be the v0.87 (Giant) release
or later. To replay an RBD workload, `librbd` on the client must be the Giant
release or later.

Capture and replay takes three steps:

1. Capture the trace. Make sure to capture `pthread_id` context:

   ```
   mkdir -p traces
   lttng create -o traces librbd
   lttng enable-event -u 'librbd:*'
   lttng add-context -u -t pthread_id
   lttng start
   # run RBD workload here
   lttng stop
   ```
2. Process the trace with [rbd-replay-prep](../../man/8/rbd-replay-prep.md):

   ```
   rbd-replay-prep traces/ust/uid/*/* replay.bin
   ```
3. Replay the trace with [rbd-replay](../../man/8/rbd-replay.md). Use read-only until you know
   it’s doing what you want:

   ```
   rbd-replay --read-only replay.bin
   ```

> **Important:**
>
> `rbd-replay` will destroy data by default. Do not use against
> an image you wish to keep, unless you use the `--read-only` option.

The replayed workload does not have to be against the same RBD image or even the
same cluster as the captured workload. To account for differences, you may need
to use the `--pool` and `--map-image` options of `rbd-replay`.
