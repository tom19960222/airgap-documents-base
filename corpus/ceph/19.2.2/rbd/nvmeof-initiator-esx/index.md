# NVMe/TCP Initiator for VMware ESX

## Prerequisites

- A VMware ESXi host running VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) 7.0U3 version or later.
- Deployed Ceph NVMe-oF gateway.
- Ceph cluster with NVMe-oF configuration.
- Subsystem defined in the gateway.

## Configuration

The following instructions will use the default vSphere web client and esxcli.

1. Enable NVMe/TCP on a NIC:

   ```
   esxcli nvme fabric enable --protocol TCP --device vmnicN
   ```

   Replace `N` with the number of the NIC.
2. Tag a VMKernel NIC to permit NVMe/TCP traffic:

   ```
   esxcli network uip interface tag add --interface-nme vmkN --tagname NVMeTCP
   ```

   Replace `N` with the ID of the VMkernel.
3. Configure the VMware ESXi host for NVMe/TCP:

   > 1. List the NVMe-oF adapter:
   >
   >    ```
   >    esxcli nvme adapter list
   >    ```
   > 2. Discover NVMe-oF subsystems:
   >
   >    ```
   >    esxcli nvme fabric discover -a NVME_TCP_ADAPTER -i GATEWAY_IP -p 4420
   >    ```
   > 3. Connect to NVME-oF gateway subsystem:
   >
   >    ```
   >    esxcli nvme connect -a NVME_TCP_ADAPTER -i GATEWAY_IP -p 4420 -s SUBSYSTEM_NQN
   >    ```
   > 4. List the NVMe/TCP controllers:
   >
   >    ```
   >    esxcli nvme controller list
   >    ```
   > 5. List the NVMe-oF namespaces in the subsystem:
   >
   >    ```
   >    esxcli nvme namespace list
   >    ```
4. Verify that the initiator has been set up correctly:

   > 1. From the vSphere client go to the ESXi host.
   > 2. On the Storage page go to the Devices tab.
   > 3. Verify that the NVME/TCP disks are listed in the table.
