# Service Management

A service is a group of daemons configured together. See these chapters
for details on individual services:

- [MON Service](mon/index.md)
- [MGR Service](mgr/index.md)
- [OSD Service](osd/index.md)
- [RGW Service](rgw/index.md)
- [MDS Service](mds/index.md)
- [NFS Service](nfs/index.md)
- [iSCSI Service](iscsi/index.md)
- [Custom Container Service](custom-container/index.md)
- [Monitoring Services](monitoring/index.md)
- [SNMP Gateway Service](snmp-gateway/index.md)
- [Tracing Services](tracing/index.md)
- [SMB Service](smb/index.md)

## Service Status

To see the status of one
of the services running in the Ceph cluster, do the following:

1. Use the command line to print a list of services.
2. Locate the service whose status you want to check.
3. Print the status of the service.

The following command prints a list of services known to the orchestrator. To
limit the output to services only on a specified host, use the optional
`--host` parameter. To limit the output to services of only a particular
type, use the optional `--type` parameter (mon, osd, mgr, mds, rgw):

> ```
> ceph orch ls [--service_type type] [--service_name name] [--export] [--format f] [--refresh]
> ```

Discover the status of a particular service or daemon:

> ```
> ceph orch ls --service_type type --service_name <name> [--refresh]
> ```

To export the service specifications knows to the orchestrator, run the following command.

> ```
> ceph orch ls --export
> ```

The service specifications exported with this command will be exported as yaml
and that yaml can be used with the `ceph orch apply -i` command.

For information about retrieving the specifications of single services (including examples of commands), see [Retrieving the running Service Specification](index.md#orchestrator-cli-service-spec-retrieve).

## Daemon Status

A daemon is a systemd unit that is running and part of a service.

To see the status of a daemon, do the following:

1. Print a list of all daemons known to the orchestrator.
2. Query the status of the target daemon.

First, print a list of all daemons known to the orchestrator:

> ```
> ceph orch ps [--hostname host] [--daemon_type type] [--service_name name] [--daemon_id id] [--format f] [--refresh]
> ```

Then query the status of a particular service instance (mon, osd, mds, rgw).
For OSDs the id is the numeric OSD ID. For MDS services the id is the file
system name:

> ```
> ceph orch ps --daemon_type osd --daemon_id 0
> ```

> **Note:**
>
> The output of the command `ceph orch ps` may not reflect the current status of the daemons. By default,
> the status is updated every 10 minutes. This interval can be shortened by modifying the `mgr/cephadm/daemon_cache_timeout`
> configuration variable (in seconds) e.g: `ceph config set mgr mgr/cephadm/daemon_cache_timeout 60` would reduce the refresh
> interval to one minute. The information is updated every `daemon_cache_timeout` seconds unless the `--refresh` option
> is used. This option would trigger a request to refresh the information, which may take some time depending on the size of
> the cluster. In general `REFRESHED` value indicates how recent the information displayed by `ceph orch ps` and similar
> commands is.

## Service Specification

A *Service Specification* is a data structure that is used to specify the
deployment of services. In addition to parameters such as placement or
networks, the user can set initial values of service configuration parameters
by means of the config section. For each param/value configuration pair,
cephadm calls the following command to set its value:

> ```
> ceph config set <service-name> <param> <value>
> ```

cephadm raises health warnings in case invalid configuration parameters are
found in the spec (CEPHADM_INVALID_CONFIG_OPTION) or if any error while
trying to apply the new configuration option(s) (CEPHADM_FAILED_SET_OPTION).

Here is an example of a service specification in YAML:

```yaml
service_type: rgw
service_id: realm.zone
placement:
  hosts:
    - host1
    - host2
    - host3
config:
  param_1: val_1
  ...
  param_N: val_N
unmanaged: false
networks:
- 192.169.142.0/24
spec:
  # Additional service specific attributes.
```

In this example, the properties of this service specification are:

*class* ceph.deployment.service_spec.ServiceSpec(*service_type*, *service_id=None*, *placement=None*, *count=None*, *config=None*, *unmanaged=False*, *preview_only=False*, *networks=None*, *targets=None*, *extra_container_args=None*, *extra_entrypoint_args=None*, *custom_configs=None*)
:   Details of service creation.

    Request to the orchestrator for a cluster of daemons
    such as MDS, RGW, iscsi gateway, nvmeof gateway, MONs, MGRs, Prometheus

    This structure is supposed to be enough information to
    start the services.

    networks*: List[str]*
    :   A list of network identities instructing the daemons to only bind
        on the particular networks in that list. In case the cluster is distributed
        across multiple networks, you can add multiple networks. See
        [Networks and Ports](monitoring/index.md#cephadm-monitoring-networks-ports),
        [Specifying Networks](rgw/index.md#cephadm-rgw-networks) and [Specifying Networks](mgr/index.md#cephadm-mgr-networks).

    placement*: [PlacementSpec](../../mgr/orchestrator_modules/index.md#ceph.deployment.service_spec.PlacementSpec "ceph.deployment.service_spec.PlacementSpec")*
    :   See [Daemon Placement](index.md#orchestrator-cli-placement-spec).

    service_id
    :   The name of the service. Required for `iscsi`, `nvmeof`, `mds`, `nfs`, `osd`,
        `rgw`, `container`, `ingress`

    service_type
    :   The type of the service. Needs to be either a Ceph
        service (`mon`, `crash`, `mds`, `mgr`, `osd` or
        `rbd-mirror`), a gateway (`nfs` or `rgw`), part of the
        monitoring stack (`alertmanager`, `grafana`, `node-exporter` or
        `prometheus`) or (`container`) for custom containers.

    unmanaged
    :   If set to `true`, the orchestrator will not deploy nor remove
        any daemon associated with this service. Placement and all other properties
        will be ignored. This is useful, if you do not want this service to be
        managed temporarily. For cephadm, See [Disabling automatic deployment of daemons](index.md#cephadm-spec-unmanaged)

Each service type can have additional service-specific properties.

Service specifications of type `mon`, `mgr`, and the monitoring
types do not require a `service_id`.

A service of type `osd` is described in [Advanced OSD Service Specifications](osd/index.md#drivegroups)

Many service specifications can be applied at once using `ceph orch apply -i`
by submitting a multi-document YAML file:

```
cat <<EOF | ceph orch apply -i -
service_type: mon
placement:
  host_pattern: "mon*"
---
service_type: mgr
placement:
  host_pattern: "mgr*"
---
service_type: osd
service_id: default_drive_group
placement:
  host_pattern: "osd*"
data_devices:
  all: true
EOF
```

### Retrieving the running Service Specification

If the services have been started via `ceph orch apply...`, then directly changing
the Services Specification is complicated. Instead of attempting to directly change
the Services Specification, we suggest exporting the running Service Specification by
following these instructions:

> ```
> ceph orch ls --service-name rgw.<realm>.<zone> --export > rgw.<realm>.<zone>.yaml
> ceph orch ls --service-type mgr --export > mgr.yaml
> ceph orch ls --export > cluster.yaml
> ```

The Specification can then be changed and re-applied as above.

### Updating Service Specifications

The Ceph Orchestrator maintains a declarative state of each
service in a `ServiceSpec`. For certain operations, like updating
the RGW HTTP port, we need to update the existing
specification.

1. List the current `ServiceSpec`:

   ```
   ceph orch ls --service_name=<service-name> --export > myservice.yaml
   ```
2. Update the yaml file:

   ```
   vi myservice.yaml
   ```
3. Apply the new `ServiceSpec`:

   ```
   ceph orch apply -i myservice.yaml [--dry-run]
   ```

## Daemon Placement

For the orchestrator to deploy a *service*, it needs to know where to deploy
*daemons*, and how many to deploy. This is the role of a placement
specification. Placement specifications can either be passed as command line arguments
or in a YAML files.

> **Note:**
>
> cephadm will not deploy daemons on hosts with the `_no_schedule` label; see [Special host labels](../host-management/index.md#cephadm-special-host-labels).

> **Note:**
>
> The **apply** command can be confusing. For this reason, we recommend using
> YAML specifications.
>
> Each `ceph orch apply <service-name>` command supersedes the one before it.
> If you do not use the proper syntax, you will clobber your work
> as you go.
>
> For example:
>
> ```
> ceph orch apply mon host1
> ceph orch apply mon host2
> ceph orch apply mon host3
> ```
>
> This results in only one host having a monitor applied to it: host 3.
>
> (The first command creates a monitor on host1. Then the second command
> clobbers the monitor on host1 and creates a monitor on host2. Then the
> third command clobbers the monitor on host2 and creates a monitor on
> host3. In this scenario, at this point, there is a monitor ONLY on
> host3.)
>
> To make certain that a monitor is applied to each of these three hosts,
> run a command like this:
>
> ```
> ceph orch apply mon "host1,host2,host3"
> ```
>
> There is another way to apply monitors to multiple hosts: a `yaml` file
> can be used. Instead of using the “ceph orch apply mon” commands, run a
> command of this form:
>
> ```
> ceph orch apply -i file.yaml
> ```
>
> Here is a sample **file.yaml** file
>
> ```yaml
> service_type: mon
> placement:
>   hosts:
>    - host1
>    - host2
>    - host3
> ```

### Explicit placements

Daemons can be explicitly placed on hosts by simply specifying them:

> ```
> ceph orch apply prometheus --placement="host1 host2 host3"
> ```

Or in YAML:

```yaml
service_type: prometheus
placement:
  hosts:
    - host1
    - host2
    - host3
```

MONs and other services may require some enhanced network specifications:

> ```
> ceph orch daemon add mon --placement="myhost:[v2:1.2.3.4:3300,v1:1.2.3.4:6789]=name"
> ```

where `[v2:1.2.3.4:3300,v1:1.2.3.4:6789]` is the network address of the monitor
and `=name` specifies the name of the new monitor.

### Placement by labels

Daemon placement can be limited to hosts that match a specific label. To set
a label `mylabel` to the appropriate hosts, run this command:

> ```
> ceph orch host label add *<hostname>* mylabel
> ```
>
> To view the current hosts and labels, run this command:
>
> ```
> ceph orch host ls
> ```
>
> For example:
>
> ```
> ceph orch host label add host1 mylabel
> ceph orch host label add host2 mylabel
> ceph orch host label add host3 mylabel
> ceph orch host ls
> ```
>
> ```bash
> HOST   ADDR   LABELS  STATUS
> host1         mylabel
> host2         mylabel
> host3         mylabel
> host4
> host5
> ```

Now, Tell cephadm to deploy daemons based on the label by running
this command:

> ```
> ceph orch apply prometheus --placement="label:mylabel"
> ```

Or in YAML:

```yaml
service_type: prometheus
placement:
  label: "mylabel"
```

- See [Host labels](../host-management/index.md#orchestrator-host-labels)

### Placement by pattern matching

Daemons can be placed on hosts using a host pattern as well.
By default, the host pattern is matched using fnmatch which supports
UNIX shell-style wildcards (see <https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html>):

> ```
> ceph orch apply prometheus --placement='myhost[1-3]'
> ```

Or in YAML:

```yaml
service_type: prometheus
placement:
  host_pattern: "myhost[1-3]"
```

To place a service on *all* hosts, use `"*"`:

> ```
> ceph orch apply node-exporter --placement='*'
> ```

Or in YAML:

```yaml
service_type: node-exporter
placement:
  host_pattern: "*"
```

The host pattern also has support for using a regex. To use a regex, you
must either add “regex: “ to the start of the pattern when using the
command line, or specify a `pattern_type` field to be “regex”
when using YAML.

On the command line:

```
ceph orch apply prometheus --placement='regex:FOO[0-9]|BAR[0-9]'
```

In YAML:

```yaml
service_type: prometheus
placement:
  host_pattern:
    pattern: 'FOO[0-9]|BAR[0-9]'
    pattern_type: regex
```

### Changing the number of daemons

By specifying `count`, only the number of daemons specified will be created:

> ```
> ceph orch apply prometheus --placement=3
> ```

To deploy *daemons* on a subset of hosts, specify the count:

> ```
> ceph orch apply prometheus --placement="2 host1 host2 host3"
> ```

If the count is bigger than the amount of hosts, cephadm deploys one per host:

> ```
> ceph orch apply prometheus --placement="3 host1 host2"
> ```

The command immediately above results in two Prometheus daemons.

YAML can also be used to specify limits, in the following way:

```yaml
service_type: prometheus
placement:
  count: 3
```

YAML can also be used to specify limits on hosts:

```yaml
service_type: prometheus
placement:
  count: 2
  hosts:
    - host1
    - host2
    - host3
```

### Co-location of daemons

Cephadm supports the deployment of multiple daemons on the same host:

```yaml
service_type: rgw
placement:
  label: rgw
  count_per_host: 2
```

The main reason for deploying multiple daemons per host is an additional
performance benefit for running multiple RGW and MDS daemons on the same host.

See also:

- [Allow co-location of MGR daemons](mgr/index.md#cephadm-mgr-co-location).
- [Designated gateways](rgw/index.md#cephadm-rgw-designated-gateways).

This feature was introduced in Pacific.

### Algorithm description

Cephadm’s declarative state consists of a list of service specifications
containing placement specifications.

Cephadm continually compares a list of daemons actually running in the cluster
against the list in the service specifications. Cephadm adds new daemons and
removes old daemons as necessary in order to conform to the service
specifications.

Cephadm does the following to maintain compliance with the service
specifications.

Cephadm first selects a list of candidate hosts. Cephadm seeks explicit host
names and selects them. If cephadm finds no explicit host names, it looks for
label specifications. If no label is defined in the specification, cephadm
selects hosts based on a host pattern. If no host pattern is defined, as a last
resort, cephadm selects all known hosts as candidates.

Cephadm is aware of existing daemons running services and tries to avoid moving
them.

Cephadm supports the deployment of a specific amount of services.
Consider the following service specification:

```yaml
service_type: mds
service_name: myfs
placement:
  count: 3
  label: myfs
```

This service specification instructs cephadm to deploy three daemons on hosts
labeled `myfs` across the cluster.

If there are fewer than three daemons deployed on the candidate hosts, cephadm
randomly chooses hosts on which to deploy new daemons.

If there are more than three daemons deployed on the candidate hosts, cephadm
removes existing daemons.

Finally, cephadm removes daemons on hosts that are outside of the list of
candidate hosts.

> **Note:**
>
> There is a special case that cephadm must consider.
>
> If there are fewer hosts selected by the placement specification than
> demanded by `count`, cephadm will deploy only on the selected hosts.

## Extra Container Arguments

> **Warning:**
>
> The arguments provided for extra container args are limited to whatever arguments are available for
> a run command from whichever container engine you are using. Providing any arguments the run
> command does not support (or invalid values for arguments) will cause the daemon to fail to start.

> **Note:**
>
> For arguments passed to the process running inside the container rather than the for
> the container runtime itself, see [Extra Entrypoint Arguments](index.md#cephadm-extra-entrypoint-args)

Cephadm supports providing extra miscellaneous container arguments for
specific cases when they may be necessary. For example, if a user needed
to limit the amount of cpus their mon daemons make use of they could apply
a spec like

```yaml
service_type: mon
service_name: mon
placement:
  hosts:
    - host1
    - host2
    - host3
extra_container_args:
  - "--cpus=2"
```

which would cause each mon daemon to be deployed with --cpus=2.

There are two ways to express arguments in the `extra_container_args` list.
To start, an item in the list can be a string. When passing an argument
as a string and the string contains spaces, Cephadm will automatically split it
into multiple arguments. For example, `--cpus 2` would become `["--cpus",
"2"]` when processed. Example:

```yaml
service_type: mon
service_name: mon
placement:
  hosts:
    - host1
    - host2
    - host3
extra_container_args:
  - "--cpus 2"
```

As an alternative, an item in the list can be an object (mapping) containing
the required key “argument” and an optional key “split”. The value associated
with the `argument` key must be a single string. The value associated with
the `split` key is a boolean value. The `split` key explicitly controls if
spaces in the argument value cause the value to be split into multiple
arguments. If `split` is true then Cephadm will automatically split the value
into multiple arguments. If `split` is false then spaces in the value will
be retained in the argument. The default, when `split` is not provided, is
false. Examples:

```yaml
service_type: mon
service_name: mon
placement:
  hosts:
    - tiebreaker
extra_container_args:
  # No spaces, always treated as a single argument
  - argument: "--timout=3000"
  # Splitting explicitly disabled, one single argument
  - argument: "--annotation=com.example.name=my favorite mon"
    split: false
  # Splitting explicitly enabled, will become two arguments
  - argument: "--cpuset-cpus 1-3,7-11"
    split: true
  # Splitting implicitly disabled, one single argument
  - argument: "--annotation=com.example.note=a simple example"
```

### Mounting Files with Extra Container Arguments

A common use case for extra container arguments is to mount additional
files within the container. Older versions of Ceph did not support spaces
in arguments and therefore the examples below apply to the widest range
of Ceph versions.

```yaml
extra_container_args:
  - "-v"
  - "/absolute/file/path/on/host:/absolute/file/path/in/container"
```

For example:

```yaml
extra_container_args:
  - "-v"
  - "/opt/ceph_cert/host.cert:/etc/grafana/certs/cert_file:ro"
```

## Extra Entrypoint Arguments

> **Note:**
>
> For arguments intended for the container runtime rather than the process inside
> it, see [Extra Container Arguments](index.md#cephadm-extra-container-args)

Similar to extra container args for the container runtime, Cephadm supports
appending to args passed to the entrypoint process running
within a container. For example, to set the collector textfile directory for
the node-exporter service , one could apply a service spec like

```yaml
service_type: node-exporter
service_name: node-exporter
placement:
  host_pattern: '*'
extra_entrypoint_args:
  - "--collector.textfile.directory=/var/lib/node_exporter/textfile_collector2"
```

There are two ways to express arguments in the `extra_entrypoint_args` list.
To start, an item in the list can be a string. When passing an argument as a
string and the string contains spaces, cephadm will automatically split it into
multiple arguments. For example, `--debug_ms 10` would become
`["--debug_ms", "10"]` when processed. Example:

```yaml
service_type: mon
service_name: mon
placement:
  hosts:
    - host1
    - host2
    - host3
extra_entrypoint_args:
  - "--debug_ms 2"
```

As an alternative, an item in the list can be an object (mapping) containing
the required key “argument” and an optional key “split”. The value associated
with the `argument` key must be a single string. The value associated with
the `split` key is a boolean value. The `split` key explicitly controls if
spaces in the argument value cause the value to be split into multiple
arguments. If `split` is true then cephadm will automatically split the value
into multiple arguments. If `split` is false then spaces in the value will
be retained in the argument. The default, when `split` is not provided, is
false. Examples:

```yaml
# An theoretical data migration service
service_type: pretend
service_name: imagine1
placement:
  hosts:
    - host1
extra_entrypoint_args:
  # No spaces, always treated as a single argument
  - argument: "--timout=30m"
  # Splitting explicitly disabled, one single argument
  - argument: "--import=/mnt/usb/My Documents"
    split: false
  # Splitting explicitly enabled, will become two arguments
  - argument: "--tag documents"
    split: true
  # Splitting implicitly disabled, one single argument
  - argument: "--title=Imported Documents"
```

## Custom Config Files

Cephadm supports specifying miscellaneous config files for daemons.
To do so, users must provide both the content of the config file and the
location within the daemon’s container at which it should be mounted. After
applying a YAML spec with custom config files specified and having cephadm
redeploy the daemons for which the config files are specified, these files will
be mounted within the daemon’s container at the specified location.

Example service spec:

```yaml
service_type: grafana
service_name: grafana
custom_configs:
  - mount_path: /etc/example.conf
    content: |
      setting1 = value1
      setting2 = value2
  - mount_path: /usr/share/grafana/example.cert
    content: |
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      V2VyIGRhcyBsaWVzdCBpc3QgZG9vZi4gTG9yZW0gaXBzdW0gZG9sb3Igc2l0IGFt
      ZXQsIGNvbnNldGV0dXIgc2FkaXBzY2luZyBlbGl0ciwgc2VkIGRpYW0gbm9udW15

      YSBhbGlxdXlhbSBlcmF0LCBzZWQgZGlhbSB2b2x1cHR1YS4gQXQgdmVybyBlb3Mg
      ZXQgYWNjdXNhbSBldCBqdXN0byBkdW8=
      -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      V2VyIGRhcyBsaWVzdCBpc3QgZG9vZi4gTG9yZW0gaXBzdW0gZG9sb3Igc2l0IGFt

      ZXQgYWNjdXNhbSBldCBqdXN0byBkdW8=
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

To make these new config files actually get mounted within the
containers for the daemons

```
ceph orch redeploy <service-name>
```

For example:

```
ceph orch redeploy grafana
```

## Removing a Service

In order to remove a service including the removal
of all daemons of that service, run

```
ceph orch rm <service-name>
```

For example:

```
ceph orch rm rgw.myrgw
```

## Disabling automatic deployment of daemons

Cephadm supports disabling the automated deployment and removal of daemons on a
per service basis. The CLI supports two commands for this.

In order to fully remove a service, see [Removing a Service](index.md#orch-rm).

### Disabling automatic management of daemons

To disable the automatic management of dameons, set `unmanaged=True` in the
[Service Specification](index.md#orchestrator-cli-service-spec) (`mgr.yaml`).

`mgr.yaml`:

```yaml
service_type: mgr
unmanaged: true
placement:
  label: mgr
```

```
ceph orch apply -i mgr.yaml
```

Cephadm also supports setting the unmanaged parameter to true or false
using the `ceph orch set-unmanaged` and `ceph orch set-managed` commands.
The commands take the service name (as reported in `ceph orch ls`) as
the only argument. For example,

```
ceph orch set-unmanaged mon
```

would set `unmanaged: true` for the mon service and

```
ceph orch set-managed mon
```

would set `unmanaged: false` for the mon service

> **Note:**
>
> After you apply this change in the Service Specification, cephadm will no
> longer deploy any new daemons (even if the placement specification matches
> additional hosts).

> **Note:**
>
> The “osd” service used to track OSDs that are not tied to any specific
> service spec is special and will always be marked unmanaged. Attempting
> to modify it with `ceph orch set-unmanaged` or `ceph orch set-managed`
> will result in a message `No service of name osd found. Check "ceph orch ls" for all known services`

### Deploying a daemon on a host manually

> **Note:**
>
> This workflow has a very limited use case and should only be used
> in rare circumstances.

To manually deploy a daemon on a host, follow these steps:

Modify the service spec for a service by getting the
existing spec, adding `unmanaged: true`, and applying the modified spec.

Then manually deploy the daemon using the following:

> ```
> ceph orch daemon add <daemon-type>  --placement=<placement spec>
> ```

For example :

> ```
> ceph orch daemon add mgr --placement=my_host
> ```

> **Note:**
>
> Removing `unmanaged: true` from the service spec will
> enable the reconciliation loop for this service and will
> potentially lead to the removal of the daemon, depending
> on the placement spec.

### Removing a daemon from a host manually

To manually remove a daemon, run a command of the following form:

> ```
> ceph orch daemon rm <daemon name>... [--force]
> ```

For example:

> ```
> ceph orch daemon rm mgr.my_host.xyzxyz
> ```

> **Note:**
