# Converting an existing cluster to cephadm

It is possible to convert some existing clusters so that they can be managed
with `cephadm`. This statement applies to some clusters that were deployed
with `ceph-deploy`, `ceph-ansible`, or `DeepSea`.

This section of the documentation explains how to determine whether your
clusters can be converted to a state in which they can be managed by
`cephadm` and how to perform those conversions.

## Limitations

- Cephadm works only with BlueStore OSDs.

## Preparation

1. Make sure that the `cephadm` command line tool is available on each host
   in the existing cluster. See [Install cephadm](../install/index.md#get-cephadm) to learn how.
2. Prepare each host for use by `cephadm` by running this command on that host:

   ```
   cephadm prepare-host
   ```
3. Choose a version of Ceph to use for the conversion. This procedure will work
   with any release of Ceph that is Octopus (15.2.z) or later. The
   latest stable release of Ceph is the default. You might be upgrading from an
   earlier Ceph release at the same time that you’re performing this
   conversion. If you are upgrading from an earlier release, make sure to
   follow any upgrade-related instructions for that release.

   Pass the Ceph container image to cephadm with the following command:

   ```
   cephadm --image $IMAGE <rest of command goes here>
   ```

   The conversion begins.
4. Confirm that the conversion is underway by running `cephadm ls` and
   making sure that the style of the daemons is changed:

   ```
   cephadm ls
   ```

   Before starting the conversion process, `cephadm ls` reports all existing
   daemons with the style `legacy`. As the adoption process progresses,
   adopted daemons will appear with the style `cephadm:v1`.

## Adoption process

1. Make sure that the ceph configuration has been migrated to use the cluster’s
   central config database. If `/etc/ceph/ceph.conf` is identical on all
   hosts, then the following command can be run on one host and will take
   effect for all hosts:

   ```
   ceph config assimilate-conf -i /etc/ceph/ceph.conf
   ```

   If there are configuration variations between hosts, you will need to repeat
   this command on each host, taking care that if there are conflicting option
   settings across hosts, the values from the last host will be used. During this
   adoption process, view the cluster’s central
   configuration to confirm that it is complete by running the following
   command:

   ```
   ceph config dump
   ```
2. Adopt each Monitor:

   ```
   cephadm adopt --style legacy --name mon.<hostname>
   ```

   Each legacy Monitor will stop, quickly restart as a cephadm
   container, and rejoin the quorum.
3. Adopt each Manager:

   ```
   cephadm adopt --style legacy --name mgr.<hostname>
   ```
4. Enable cephadm orchestration:

   ```
   ceph mgr module enable cephadm
   ceph orch set backend cephadm
   ```
5. Generate an SSH key for cephadm:

   ```
   ceph cephadm generate-key
   ceph cephadm get-pub-key > ~/ceph.pub
   ```
6. Install the cephadm SSH key on each host in the cluster:

   ```
   ssh-copy-id -f -i ~/ceph.pub root@<host>
   ```

   > **Note:**
   >
   > It is also possible to import an existing SSH key. See
   > [SSH errors](../troubleshooting/index.md#cephadm-ssh-errors) in the troubleshooting
   > document for instructions that describe how to import existing
   > SSH keys.

   > **Note:**
   >
   > It is also possible to arrange for cephadm to use a non-root user to SSH
   > into cluster hosts. This user needs to have passwordless sudo access.
   > Use `ceph cephadm set-user <user>` and copy the SSH key to that user’s
   > home directory on each host.
   > See [Configuring a different SSH user](../host-management/index.md#cephadm-ssh-user)
7. Tell cephadm which hosts to manage:

   ```
   ceph orch host add <hostname> [ip-address]
   ```

   This will run `cephadm check-host` on each host before adding it.
   This check ensures that the host is functioning properly. The IP address
   argument is recommended. If the address is not provided, then the host name
   will be resolved via DNS.
8. Verify that the adopted monitor and manager daemons are visible:

   ```
   ceph orch ps
   ```
9. Adopt all OSDs in the cluster:

   ```
   cephadm adopt --style legacy --name <name>
   ```

   For example:

   ```
   cephadm adopt --style legacy --name osd.1
   cephadm adopt --style legacy --name osd.2
   ```
10. Redeploy CephFS MDS daemons (if deployed) by telling cephadm how many daemons to run for
    each file system. List CephFS file systems by name with the command `ceph fs
    ls`. Run the following command on the master nodes to redeploy the MDS
    daemons:

    ```
    ceph orch apply mds <fs-name> [--placement=<placement>]
    ```

    For example, in a cluster with a single file system called foo:

    ```
    ceph fs ls
    ```

    ```bash
    name: foo, metadata pool: foo_metadata, data pools: [foo_data ]
    ```

    ```
    ceph orch apply mds foo 2
    ```

    Confirm that the new MDS daemons have started:

    ```
    ceph orch ps --daemon-type mds
    ```

    Finally, stop and remove the legacy MDS daemons:

    ```
    systemctl stop ceph-mds.target
    rm -rf /var/lib/ceph/mds/ceph-*
    ```
11. Redeploy Ceph Object Gateway RGW daemons if deployed. Cephadm manages RGW
    daemons by zone. For each zone, deploy new RGW daemons with cephadm:

    ```
    ceph orch apply rgw <svc_id> [--realm=<realm>] [--zone=<zone>] [--port=<port>] [--ssl] [--placement=<placement>]
    ```

    where *<placement>* can be a simple daemon count, or a list of
    specific hosts (see [Daemon Placement](../services/index.md#orchestrator-cli-placement-spec)). The
    zone and realm arguments are needed only for a multisite setup.

    After the daemons have started and you have confirmed that they are
    functioning, stop and remove the legacy daemons:

    ```
    systemctl stop ceph-rgw.target
    rm -rf /var/lib/ceph/radosgw/ceph-*
    ```
12. Check the output of the command `ceph health detail` for cephadm warnings
    about stray cluster daemons or hosts that are not yet managed by cephadm.
