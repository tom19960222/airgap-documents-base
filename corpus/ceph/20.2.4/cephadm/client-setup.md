# Basic Ceph Client Setup
Client hosts require basic configuration to interact with
Ceph clusters. This section describes how to perform this configuration.

> **Note:**
> Most client hosts need to install only the ``ceph-common`` package
> and its dependencies. Such an installation supplies the basic ``ceph`` and
> ``rados`` commands, as well as other commands including ``mount.ceph``
> and ``rbd``.

# Config File Setup
Client hosts  usually require smaller configuration files (here
sometimes called "config files") than do back-end cluster hosts.
To generate a minimal config file, log into a host that has been
configured as a client or that is running a cluster daemon, then
run the following command:

```bash
ceph config generate-minimal-conf
```

This command generates a minimal config file that tells the client how
to reach the Ceph Monitors. This file should usually
be copied to ``/etc/ceph/ceph.conf`` on each client host.

# Keyring Setup
Most Ceph clusters run with authentication enabled. This means that
the client needs keys in order to communicate with Ceph daemons.
To generate a keyring file with credentials for ``client.fs``,
log into an running cluster member and run the following command:

```bash
ceph auth get-or-create client.fs
```

The resulting output is directed into a keyring file, typically
``/etc/ceph/ceph.keyring``.

To gain a broader understanding of client keyring distribution and administration,
you should read [client_keyrings_and_configs](operations.md#client-keyrings-and-configs).

To see an example that explains how to distribute ``ceph.conf`` configuration
files to hosts that are tagged with the ``bare_config`` label, you should read
the subsection named "Distributing ceph.conf to hosts tagged with bare_config"
under the heading [etc_ceph_conf_distribution](operations.md#etc-ceph-conf-distribution).
