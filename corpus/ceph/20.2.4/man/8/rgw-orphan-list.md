# rgw-orphan-list -- list rados objects that are not indexed by rgw

.. program:: rgw-orphan-list

## Synopsis

| **rgw-orphan-list**

## Description

rgw-orphan-list is an *EXPERIMENTAL* RADOS gateway user
administration utility. It produces a listing of rados objects that
are not directly or indirectly referenced through the bucket indexes
on a pool. It places the results and intermediate files on the local
filesystem rather than on the ceph cluster itself, and therefore will
not itself consume additional cluster storage.

In theory orphans should not exist. However because ceph evolves
rapidly, bugs do crop up, and they may result in orphans that are left
behind.

In its current form this utility does not take any command-line
arguments or options. It will list the available pools and prompt the
user to enter the pool they would like to list orphans for.

Behind the scenes it runs `rados ls` and `radosgw-admin bucket
radoslist ...` and produces a list of those entries that appear in the
former but not the latter. Those entries are presumed to be the
orphans.

## Warnings

This utility is currently considered *EXPERIMENTAL*.

This utility will produce false orphan entries for unindexed buckets
since such buckets have no bucket indices that can provide the
starting point for tracing.

## Options

At present there are no options.

## Examples

Launch the tool:

```
$ rgw-orphan-list
```

## Availability

radosgw-admin is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source,
distributed storage system.  Please refer to the Ceph documentation at
https://docs.ceph.com for more information.
