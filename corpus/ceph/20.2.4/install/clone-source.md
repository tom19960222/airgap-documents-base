# Cloning the Ceph Source Code Repository

To clone a Ceph branch of the Ceph source code, go to [github Ceph Repository](https://github.com/ceph/ceph), select a branch (``main`` by default), and click the **Download
ZIP** button.

To clone the entire git repository, [install](clone-source.md#install-git) and configure
``git``.

<a id="install-git"></a>

## Install Git

To install ``git`` on Debian/Ubuntu, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

To install ``git`` on CentOS/RHEL, run the following command:

```bash
sudo yum install git
```

You must have a ``github`` account. If you do not have a ``github``
account, go to [github.com](https://github.com) and register.  Follow the directions for setting
up git at [Set Up Git](https://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git).

## Add SSH Keys (Optional)

To commit code to Ceph or to clone the respository by using SSH
(``git@github.com:ceph/ceph.git``), you must generate SSH keys for github.

> **Tip:** If you want only to clone the repository, you can
> use ``git clone --recursive https://github.com/ceph/ceph.git``
> without generating SSH keys.

To generate SSH keys for ``github``, run the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

To print the SSH key that you just generated and that you will add to your
``github`` account, use the ``cat`` command. (The following example assumes you
used the default file path.):

```bash
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy the public key.

Go to your ``github`` account, click "Account Settings" (represented by the
'tools' icon), and click "SSH Keys" on the left side navbar.

Click "Add SSH key" in the "SSH Keys" list, enter a name for the key, paste the
key you generated, and press the "Add key" button.

## Clone the Source

To clone the Ceph source code repository, run the following command:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ceph/ceph.git
```

After ``git clone`` has run, you should have a full copy of the Ceph
repository.

> **Tip:** Make sure you maintain the latest copies of the submodules included in
> the repository. Running ``git status`` will tell you whether the submodules
> are out of date. See [update-submodules](clone-source.md#update-submodules) for more information.

```bash
cd ceph
git status
```

<a id="update-submodules"></a>

### Updating Submodules

If your submodules are out of date, run the following commands:

```bash
git submodule update --force --init --recursive --progress
git clean -fdx
git submodule foreach git clean -fdx
```

If you still have problems with a submodule directory, use ``rm -rf [directory
name]`` to remove the directory. Then run ``git submodule update --init
--recursive --progress`` again.

## Choose a Branch

Once you clone the source code and submodules, your Ceph repository
will be on the ``main`` branch by default, which is the unstable
development branch. You may choose other branches too.

- ``main``: The unstable development branch.
- ``stable-release-name``: The name of the stable, [Active Releases](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/releases/#active-releases). e.g. ``Pacific``
- ``next``: The release candidate branch.

:

```
git checkout main
```
