# Windows basic configuration

This page describes the minimum Ceph configuration required for using the
client components on Windows.

# ceph.conf

The default location for the ``ceph.conf`` file on Windows is
``%ProgramData%\ceph\ceph.conf``, which usually expands to
``C:\ProgramData\ceph\ceph.conf``.

Below you may find a sample. Please fill in the monitor addresses
accordingly.

```ini
[global]
    log to stderr = true
    ; Uncomment the following in order to use the Windows Event Log
    ; log to syslog = true

    run dir = C:/ProgramData/ceph/out
    crash dir = C:/ProgramData/ceph/out

    ; Use the following to change the cephfs client log level
    ; debug client = 2
[client]
    keyring = C:/ProgramData/ceph/keyring
    ; log file = C:/ProgramData/ceph/out/$name.$pid.log
    admin socket = C:/ProgramData/ceph/out/$name.$pid.asok

    ; client_permissions = true
    ; client_mount_uid = 1000
    ; client_mount_gid = 1000
[global]
    mon host = <ceph_monitor_addresses>
```

Don't forget to also copy your keyring file to the specified location and make
sure that the configured directories exist (e.g. ``C:\ProgramData\ceph\out``).

Please use slashes ``/`` instead of backslashes ``\`` as path separators
within ``ceph.conf``.
