# Troubleshooting

This document describes how to troubleshoot Cilium in different deployment
modes. It focuses on a full deployment of Cilium within a datacenter or public
cloud. If you are just looking for a simple way to experiment, we highly
recommend trying out the [getting_started](../index.md#getting_started) guide instead.

This guide assumes that you have read the [network_root](../network/concepts/index.md#network_root) and `security_root` which explain all
the components and concepts.

We use GitHub issues to maintain a list of [Cilium Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Akind%2Fquestion%20). You can also check there to see if your question(s) is already
addressed.

## Component & Cluster Health

### Kubernetes

An initial overview of Cilium can be retrieved by listing all pods to verify
whether all pods have the status ``Running``:

```shell-session
$ kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l k8s-app=cilium
NAME           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cilium-2hq5z   1/1       Running   0          4d
cilium-6kbtz   1/1       Running   0          4d
cilium-klj4b   1/1       Running   0          4d
cilium-zmjj9   1/1       Running   0          4d
```

If Cilium encounters a problem that it cannot recover from, it will
automatically report the failure state via ``cilium-dbg status`` which is regularly
queried by the Kubernetes liveness probe to automatically restart Cilium pods.
If a Cilium pod is in state ``CrashLoopBackoff`` then this indicates a
permanent failure scenario.

#### Detailed Status

If a particular Cilium pod is not in running state, the status and health of
the agent on that node can be retrieved by running ``cilium-dbg status`` in the
context of that pod:

```shell-session
$ kubectl -n kube-system exec cilium-2hq5z -- cilium-dbg status
KVStore:                Ok   etcd: 1/1 connected: http://demo-etcd-lab--a.etcd.tgraf.test1.lab.corp.isovalent.link:2379 - 3.2.5 (Leader)
ContainerRuntime:       Ok   docker daemon: OK
Kubernetes:             Ok   OK
Kubernetes APIs:        ["cilium/v2::CiliumNetworkPolicy", "networking.k8s.io/v1::NetworkPolicy", "core/v1::Service", "core/v1::Endpoint", "core/v1::Node", "CustomResourceDefinition"]
Cilium:                 Ok   OK
NodeMonitor:            Disabled
Cilium health daemon:   Ok
Controller Status:      14/14 healthy
Proxy Status:           OK, ip 10.2.0.172, port-range 10000-20000
Cluster health:   4/4 reachable   (2018-06-16T09:49:58Z)
```

Alternatively, the ``k8s-cilium-exec.sh`` script can be used to run ``cilium-dbg
status`` on all nodes. This will provide detailed status and health information
of all nodes in the cluster:

```shell-session
curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cilium/cilium/main/contrib/k8s/k8s-cilium-exec.sh
chmod +x ./k8s-cilium-exec.sh
```

... and run ``cilium-dbg status`` on all nodes:

```shell-session
$ ./k8s-cilium-exec.sh cilium-dbg status
KVStore:                Ok   Etcd: http://127.0.0.1:2379 - (Leader) 3.1.10
ContainerRuntime:       Ok
Kubernetes:             Ok   OK
Kubernetes APIs:        ["networking.k8s.io/v1beta1::Ingress", "core/v1::Node", "CustomResourceDefinition", "cilium/v2::CiliumNetworkPolicy", "networking.k8s.io/v1::NetworkPolicy", "core/v1::Service", "core/v1::Endpoint"]
Cilium:                 Ok   OK
NodeMonitor:            Listening for events on 2 CPUs with 64x4096 of shared memory
Cilium health daemon:   Ok
Controller Status:      7/7 healthy
Proxy Status:           OK, ip 10.15.28.238, 0 redirects, port-range 10000-20000
Cluster health:   1/1 reachable   (2018-02-27T00:24:34Z)
```

Detailed information about the status of Cilium can be inspected with the
``cilium-dbg status --verbose`` command. Verbose output includes detailed IPAM state
(allocated addresses), Cilium controller status, and details of the Proxy
status.

<a id="ts_agent_logs"></a>

#### Logs

To retrieve log files of a cilium pod, run (replace ``cilium-1234`` with a pod
name returned by ``kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l k8s-app=cilium``)

```shell-session
kubectl -n kube-system logs --timestamps cilium-1234
```

If the cilium pod was already restarted due to the liveness problem after
encountering an issue, it can be useful to retrieve the logs of the pod before
the last restart:

```shell-session
kubectl -n kube-system logs --timestamps -p cilium-1234
```

### Generic

When logged in a host running Cilium, the cilium CLI can be invoked directly,
e.g.:

```shell-session
$ cilium-dbg status
KVStore:                Ok   etcd: 1/1 connected: https://192.168.60.11:2379 - 3.2.7 (Leader)
ContainerRuntime:       Ok
Kubernetes:             Ok   OK
Kubernetes APIs:        ["core/v1::Endpoint", "networking.k8s.io/v1beta1::Ingress", "core/v1::Node", "CustomResourceDefinition", "cilium/v2::CiliumNetworkPolicy", "networking.k8s.io/v1::NetworkPolicy", "core/v1::Service"]
Cilium:                 Ok   OK
NodeMonitor:            Listening for events on 2 CPUs with 64x4096 of shared memory
Cilium health daemon:   Ok
IPv4 address pool:      261/65535 allocated
IPv6 address pool:      4/4294967295 allocated
Controller Status:      20/20 healthy
Proxy Status:           OK, ip 10.0.28.238, port-range 10000-20000
Hubble:                 Ok      Current/Max Flows: 2542/4096 (62.06%), Flows/s: 164.21      Metrics: Disabled
Cluster health:         2/2 reachable   (2018-04-11T15:41:01Z)
```

## Observing Flows with Hubble

Hubble is a built-in observability tool which allows you to inspect recent flow
events on all endpoints managed by Cilium.

### Ensure Hubble is running correctly

To ensure the Hubble client can connect to the Hubble server running inside
Cilium, you may use the ``hubble status`` command from within a Cilium pod:

```shell-session
$ hubble status
Healthcheck (via unix:///var/run/cilium/hubble.sock): Ok
Current/Max Flows: 4095/4095 (100.00%)
Flows/s: 164.21
```

``cilium-agent`` must be running with the ``--enable-hubble`` option (default) in order
for the Hubble server to be enabled. When deploying Cilium with Helm, make sure
to set the ``hubble.enabled=true`` value.

To check if Hubble is enabled in your deployment, you may look for the
following output in ``cilium-dbg status``:

```shell-session
$ cilium status
...
Hubble:   Ok   Current/Max Flows: 4095/4095 (100.00%), Flows/s: 164.21   Metrics: Disabled
...
```

> **Note:**
> Pods need to be managed by Cilium in order to be observable by Hubble.
> See how to [ensure a pod is managed by Cilium](troubleshooting.md#ensure_managed_pod)
> for more details.

### Observing flows of a specific pod

In order to observe the traffic of a specific pod, you will first have to
[retrieve the name of the cilium instance managing it](troubleshooting.md#retrieve_cilium_pod).
The Hubble CLI is part of the Cilium container image and can be accessed via
``kubectl exec``. The following query for example will show all events related
to flows which either originated or terminated in the ``default/tiefighter`` pod
in the last three minutes:

```shell-session
$ kubectl exec -n kube-system cilium-77lk6 -- hubble observe --since 3m --pod default/tiefighter
May  4 12:47:08.811: default/tiefighter:53875 -> kube-system/coredns-74ff55c5b-66f4n:53 to-endpoint FORWARDED (UDP)
May  4 12:47:08.811: default/tiefighter:53875 -> kube-system/coredns-74ff55c5b-66f4n:53 to-endpoint FORWARDED (UDP)
May  4 12:47:08.811: default/tiefighter:53875 <- kube-system/coredns-74ff55c5b-66f4n:53 to-endpoint FORWARDED (UDP)
May  4 12:47:08.811: default/tiefighter:53875 <- kube-system/coredns-74ff55c5b-66f4n:53 to-endpoint FORWARDED (UDP)
May  4 12:47:08.811: default/tiefighter:50214 <> default/deathstar-c74d84667-cx5kp:80 to-overlay FORWARDED (TCP Flags: SYN)
May  4 12:47:08.812: default/tiefighter:50214 <- default/deathstar-c74d84667-cx5kp:80 to-endpoint FORWARDED (TCP Flags: SYN, ACK)
May  4 12:47:08.812: default/tiefighter:50214 <> default/deathstar-c74d84667-cx5kp:80 to-overlay FORWARDED (TCP Flags: ACK)
May  4 12:47:08.812: default/tiefighter:50214 <> default/deathstar-c74d84667-cx5kp:80 to-overlay FORWARDED (TCP Flags: ACK, PSH)
May  4 12:47:08.812: default/tiefighter:50214 <- default/deathstar-c74d84667-cx5kp:80 to-endpoint FORWARDED (TCP Flags: ACK, PSH)
May  4 12:47:08.812: default/tiefighter:50214 <> default/deathstar-c74d84667-cx5kp:80 to-overlay FORWARDED (TCP Flags: ACK, FIN)
May  4 12:47:08.812: default/tiefighter:50214 <- default/deathstar-c74d84667-cx5kp:80 to-endpoint FORWARDED (TCP Flags: ACK, FIN)
May  4 12:47:08.812: default/tiefighter:50214 <> default/deathstar-c74d84667-cx5kp:80 to-overlay FORWARDED (TCP Flags: ACK)
```

You may also use ``-o json`` to obtain more detailed information about each
flow event.

> **Note:**
> **Hubble Relay**  allows you to query multiple Hubble instances

> [Observing flows with Hubble Relay](troubleshooting.md#observing-flows-with-hubble-relay) for more information.

## Observing flows with Hubble Relay

Hubble Relay is a service which allows to query multiple Hubble instances
simultaneously and aggregate the results. See [hubble_setup](../observability/hubble/setup.md#hubble_setup) to enable
Hubble Relay if it is not yet enabled and install the Hubble CLI on your local
machine.

You may access the Hubble Relay service by port-forwarding it locally:

```shell-session
kubectl -n kube-system port-forward service/hubble-relay --address 0.0.0.0 --address :: 4245:80
```

This will forward the Hubble Relay service port (``80``) to your local machine
on port ``4245`` on all of it's IP addresses.

You can verify that Hubble Relay can be reached by using the Hubble CLI and
running the following command from your local machine:

```shell-session
hubble status
```

This command should return an output similar to the following:

:

```
Healthcheck (via localhost:4245): Ok
Current/Max Flows: 16380/16380 (100.00%)
Flows/s: 46.19
Connected Nodes: 4/4
```

You may see details about nodes that Hubble Relay is connected to by running
the following command:

```shell-session
hubble list nodes
```

As Hubble Relay shares the same API as individual Hubble instances, you may
follow the [Observing flows with Hubble](troubleshooting.md#observing-flows-with-hubble) section keeping in mind that
limitations with regards to what can be seen from individual Hubble instances no
longer apply.

## Connectivity Problems

### Cilium connectivity tests

The Cilium connectivity test deploys a series of services, deployments, and
CiliumNetworkPolicy which will use various connectivity paths to connect to
each other. Connectivity paths include with and without service load-balancing
and various network policy combinations.

> **Note:**
> The connectivity tests this will only work in a namespace with no other pods
> or network policies applied. If there is a Cilium Clusterwide Network Policy
> enabled, that may also break this connectivity check.

To run the connectivity tests create an isolated test namespace called
``cilium-test`` to deploy the tests with.

.. parsed-literal::

   kubectl create ns cilium-test
   kubectl apply --namespace=cilium-test -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes/connectivity-check/connectivity-check.yaml

The tests cover various functionality of the system. Below we call out each test
type. If tests pass, it suggests functionality of the referenced subsystem.

| Pod-to-pod (intra-host) | Pod-to-pod (inter-host) | Pod-to-service (intra-host) | Pod-to-service (inter-host) | Pod-to-external resource |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| eBPF routing is functional | Data plane, routing, network | eBPF service map lookup | VXLAN overlay port if used | Egress, CiliumNetworkPolicy, masquerade |

The pod name indicates the connectivity
variant and the readiness and liveness gate indicates success or failure of the
test:

```shell-session
$ kubectl get pods -n cilium-test
NAME                                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

pod-to-external-fqdn-allow-google-cnp-b7b6bcdcb-97p75   1/1     Running   0          68s
```

Information about test failures can be determined by describing a failed test
pod

```shell-session
$ kubectl describe pod pod-to-b-intra-node-hostport
  Warning  Unhealthy  6s (x6 over 56s)   kubelet, agent1    Readiness probe failed: curl: (7) Failed to connect to echo-b-host-headless port 40000: Connection refused
  Warning  Unhealthy  2s (x3 over 52s)   kubelet, agent1    Liveness probe failed: curl: (7) Failed to connect to echo-b-host-headless port 40000: Connection refused
```

<a id="cluster_connectivity_health"></a>

### Checking cluster connectivity health

Cilium can rule out network fabric related issues when troubleshooting
connectivity issues by providing reliable health and latency probes between all
cluster nodes and a simulated workload running on each node.

By default when Cilium is run, it launches instances of ``cilium-health`` in
the background to determine the overall connectivity status of the cluster. This
tool periodically runs bidirectional traffic across multiple paths through the
cluster and through each node using different protocols to determine the health
status of each path and protocol. At any point in time, cilium-health may be
queried for the connectivity status of the last probe.

```shell-session
$ kubectl -n kube-system exec -ti cilium-2hq5z -- cilium-health status
Probe time:   2018-06-16T09:51:58Z
Nodes:
  ip-172-0-52-116.us-west-2.compute.internal (localhost):
    Host connectivity to 172.0.52.116:
      ICMP to stack: OK, RTT=315.254µs
      HTTP to agent: OK, RTT=368.579µs
    Endpoint connectivity to 10.2.0.183:
      ICMP to stack: OK, RTT=190.658µs
      HTTP to agent: OK, RTT=536.665µs
  ip-172-0-117-198.us-west-2.compute.internal:
    Host connectivity to 172.0.117.198:
      ICMP to stack: OK, RTT=1.009679ms
      HTTP to agent: OK, RTT=1.808628ms
    Endpoint connectivity to 10.2.1.234:
      ICMP to stack: OK, RTT=1.016365ms
      HTTP to agent: OK, RTT=2.29877ms
```

For each node, the connectivity will be displayed for each protocol and path,
both to the node itself and to an endpoint on that node. The latency specified
is a snapshot at the last time a probe was run, which is typically once per
minute. The ICMP connectivity row represents Layer 3 connectivity to the
networking stack, while the HTTP connectivity row represents connection to an
instance of the ``cilium-health`` agent running on the host or as an endpoint.

<a id="monitor"></a>

### Monitoring Datapath State

Sometimes you may experience broken connectivity, which may be due to a
number of different causes. A main cause can be unwanted packet drops on
the networking level. The tool
``cilium-dbg monitor`` allows you to quickly inspect and see if and where packet
drops happen. Following is an example output (use ``kubectl exec`` as in
previous examples if running with Kubernetes):

```shell-session
$ kubectl -n kube-system exec -ti cilium-2hq5z -- cilium-dbg monitor --type drop
Listening for events on 2 CPUs with 64x4096 of shared memory
Press Ctrl-C to quit
xx drop (Policy denied) to endpoint 25729, identity 261->264: fd02::c0a8:210b:0:bf00 -> fd02::c0a8:210b:0:6481 EchoRequest
xx drop (Policy denied) to endpoint 25729, identity 261->264: fd02::c0a8:210b:0:bf00 -> fd02::c0a8:210b:0:6481 EchoRequest
xx drop (Policy denied) to endpoint 25729, identity 261->264: 10.11.13.37 -> 10.11.101.61 EchoRequest
xx drop (Policy denied) to endpoint 25729, identity 261->264: 10.11.13.37 -> 10.11.101.61 EchoRequest
xx drop (Invalid destination mac) to endpoint 0, identity 0->0: fe80::5c25:ddff:fe8e:78d8 -> ff02::2 RouterSolicitation
```

The above indicates that a packet to endpoint ID ``25729`` has been dropped due
to violation of the Layer 3 policy.

#### Handling drop (CT: Map insertion failed)

If connectivity fails and ``cilium-dbg monitor --type drop`` shows ``xx drop (CT:
Map insertion failed)``, then it is likely that the connection tracking table
is filling up and the automatic adjustment of the garbage collector interval is
insufficient.

Setting ``--conntrack-gc-interval`` to an interval lower than the current value
may help. This controls the time interval between two garbage collection runs.

By default ``--conntrack-gc-interval`` is set to 0 which translates to
using a dynamic interval. In that case, the interval is updated after each
garbage collection run depending on how many entries were garbage collected.
If very few or no entries were garbage collected, the interval will increase;
if many entries were garbage collected, it will decrease. The current interval
value is reported in the Cilium agent logs.

Alternatively, the value for ``bpf-ct-global-any-max`` and
``bpf-ct-global-tcp-max`` can be increased. Setting both of these options will
be a trade-off of CPU for ``conntrack-gc-interval``, and for
``bpf-ct-global-any-max`` and ``bpf-ct-global-tcp-max`` the amount of memory
consumed. You can track conntrack garbage collection related metrics such as
``datapath_conntrack_gc_runs_total`` and ``datapath_conntrack_gc_entries`` to
get visibility into garbage collection runs. Refer to [metrics](../configuration/api-rate-limiting.md#metrics) for more
details.

#### Enabling datapath debug messages

By default, datapath debug messages are disabled, and therefore not shown in
``cilium-dbg monitor -v`` output. To enable them, add ``"datapath"`` to
the ``debug-verbose`` option.

## Policy Troubleshooting

<a id="ensure_managed_pod"></a>

### Ensure pod is managed by Cilium

A potential cause for policy enforcement not functioning as expected is that
the networking of the pod selected by the policy is not being managed by
Cilium. The following situations result in unmanaged pods:

* The pod is running in host networking and will use the host's IP address
  directly. Such pods have full network connectivity but Cilium will not
  provide security policy enforcement for such pods by default. To enforce
  policy against these pods, either set ``hostNetwork`` to false or use
  [HostPolicies](../security/policy/language.md#hostpolicies).

* The pod was started before Cilium was deployed. Cilium only manages pods
  that have been deployed after Cilium itself was started. Cilium will not
  provide security policy enforcement for such pods. These pods should be
  restarted in order to ensure that Cilium can provide security policy
  enforcement.

If pod networking is not managed by Cilium. Ingress and egress policy rules
selecting the respective pods will not be applied. See the section
[network_policy](../security/policy/index.md#network_policy) for more details.

For a quick assessment of whether any pods are not managed by Cilium, the
[Cilium CLI](https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli) will print the number
of managed pods. If this prints that all of the pods are managed by Cilium,
then there is no problem:

```shell-session
$ cilium status

```shell-session
$ curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cilium/cilium/main/contrib/k8s/k8s-unmanaged.sh
$ chmod +x k8s-unmanaged.sh
$ ./k8s-unmanaged.sh
kube-system/cilium-hqpk7
kube-system/kube-addon-manager-minikube
kube-system/kube-dns-54cccfbdf8-zmv2c
kube-system/kubernetes-dashboard-77d8b98585-g52k5
kube-system/storage-provisioner
```

### Understand the rendering of your policy

There are always multiple ways to approach a problem. Cilium can provide the
rendering of the aggregate policy provided to it, leaving you to simply compare
with what you expect the policy to actually be rather than search (and
potentially overlook) every policy. At the expense of reading a very large dump
of an endpoint, this is often a faster path to discovering errant policy
requests in the Kubernetes API.

Start by finding the endpoint you are debugging from the following list. There
are several cross references for you to use in this list, including the IP
address and pod labels:

```shell-session
kubectl -n kube-system exec -ti cilium-q8wvt -- cilium-dbg endpoint list
```

When you find the correct endpoint, the first column of every row is the
endpoint ID. Use that to dump the full endpoint information:

```shell-session
kubectl -n kube-system exec -ti cilium-q8wvt -- cilium-dbg endpoint get 59084
```

![](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/2ab5f8da5915992a1e548c290105dbc08f4be52d/Documentation/operations/images/troubleshooting_policy.png)

Importing this dump into a JSON-friendly editor can help browse and navigate the
information here. At the top level of the dump, there are two nodes of note:

* ``spec``: The desired state of the endpoint
* ``status``: The current state of the endpoint

This is the standard Kubernetes control loop pattern. Cilium is the controller
here, and it is iteratively working to bring the ``status`` in line with the
``spec``.

Opening the ``status``, we can drill down through ``policy.realized.l4``. Do
your ``ingress`` and ``egress`` rules match what you expect? If not, the
reference to the errant rules can be found in the ``derived-from-rules`` node.

### Policymap pressure and overflow

The most important step in debugging policymap pressure is finding out which
node(s) are impacted.

The ``cilium_bpf_map_pressure{map_name="cilium_policy_*"}`` metric monitors the
endpoint's BPF policymap pressure. This metric exposes the maximum BPF map
pressure on the node, meaning the policymap experiencing the most pressure on a
particular node.

Once the node is known, the troubleshooting steps are as follows:

1. Find the Cilium pod on the node experiencing the problematic policymap
   pressure and obtain a shell via ``kubectl exec``.
2. Use ``cilium policy selectors`` to get an overview of which selectors are
   selecting many identities. The output of this command as of Cilium v1.15
   additionally displays the namespace and name of the policy resource of each
   selector.
3. The type of selector tells you what sort of policy rule could be having an
   impact. The three existing types of selectors are explained below, each with
   specific steps depending on the selector. See the steps below corresponding
   to the type of selector.
4. Consider bumping the policymap size as a last resort. However, keep in mind
   the following implications:

   * Increased memory consumption for each policymap.
   * Generally, as identities increase in the cluster, the more work Cilium
     performs.
   * At a broader level, if the policy posture is such that all or nearly all
     identities are selected, this suggests that the posture is too permissive.

| Selector type | Form in ``cilium policy selectors`` output |
| --- | --- |
| CIDR | ``&LabelSelector{MatchLabels:map[string]string{cidr.1.1.1.1/32: ,}`` |
| FQDN | ``MatchName: , MatchPattern: *`` |
| Label | ``&LabelSelector{MatchLabels:map[string]string{any.name: curl,k8s.io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: default,}`` |

An example output of ``cilium policy selectors``:

```shell-session
root@kind-worker:/home/cilium# cilium policy selectors

                                                                                                                                                                                                            16860327
                                                                                                                                                                                                            16860328
&LabelSelector{MatchLabels:map[string]string{any.name: netperf,k8s.io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: default,},MatchExpressions:[]LabelSelectorRequirement{},}           default/tofqdn-dns-visibility   1
&LabelSelector{MatchLabels:map[string]string{cidr.1.1.1.1/32: ,},MatchExpressions:[]LabelSelectorRequirement{},}                                                    default/tofqdn-dns-visibility   1       16860329
&LabelSelector{MatchLabels:map[string]string{cidr.1.1.1.2/32: ,},MatchExpressions:[]LabelSelectorRequirement{},}                                                    default/tofqdn-dns-visibility   1       16860330
&LabelSelector{MatchLabels:map[string]string{cidr.1.1.1.3/32: ,},MatchExpressions:[]LabelSelectorRequirement{},}                                                    default/tofqdn-dns-visibility   1       16860331
```

From the output above, we see that all three selectors are in use. The
significant action here is to determine which selector is selecting the most
identities, because the policy containing that selector is the likely cause for
the policymap pressure.

#### Label

See section on [identity-relevant labels](performance/scalability/identity-relevant-labels.md#identity-relevant-labels).

Another aspect to consider is the permissiveness of the policies and whether it
could be reduced.

#### CIDR

One way to reduce the number of identities selected by a CIDR selector is to
broaden the range of the CIDR, if possible. For example, in the above example
output, the policy contains a ``/32`` rule for each CIDR, rather than using a
wider range like ``/30`` instead. Updating the policy with this rule creates an
identity that represents all IPs within the ``/30`` and therefore, only
requires the selector to select 1 identity.

#### FQDN

See section on [isolating the source of toFQDNs issues regarding identities and policy](../contributing/development/debugging.md#isolating-source-tofqdns-issues-identities-policy).

## etcd (kvstore)

### Introduction

Cilium can be operated in CRD-mode and kvstore/etcd mode. When cilium is
running in kvstore/etcd mode, the kvstore becomes a vital component of the
overall cluster health as it is required to be available for several
operations.

Operations for which the kvstore is strictly required when running in etcd
mode:

Scheduling of new workloads:
  As part of scheduling workloads/endpoints, agents will perform security
  identity allocation which requires interaction with the kvstore. If a
  workload can be scheduled due to re-using a known security identity, then
  state propagation of the endpoint details to other nodes will still depend on
  the kvstore and thus packets drops due to policy enforcement may be observed
  as other nodes in the cluster will not be aware of the new workload.

Multi cluster:
  All state propagation between clusters depends on the kvstore.

Node discovery:
  New nodes require to register themselves in the kvstore.

Agent bootstrap:
  The Cilium agent will eventually fail if it can't connect to the kvstore at
  bootstrap time, however, the agent will still perform all possible operations
  while waiting for the kvstore to appear.

Operations which *do not* require kvstore availability:

All datapath operations:
  All datapath forwarding, policy enforcement and visibility functions for
  existing workloads/endpoints do not depend on the kvstore. Packets will
  continue to be forwarded and network policy rules will continue to be
  enforced.

  However, if the agent requires to restart as part of the
  [etcd_recovery_behavior](troubleshooting.md#etcd_recovery_behavior), there can be delays in:

  * processing of flow events and metrics
  * short unavailability of layer 7 proxies

NetworkPolicy updates:
  Network policy updates will continue to be processed and applied.

Services updates:
  All updates to services will be processed and applied.

### Understanding etcd status

The etcd status is reported when running ``cilium-dbg status``. The following line
represents the status of etcd:

```
KVStore:  Ok  etcd: 1/1 connected, lease-ID=29c6732d5d580cb5, lock lease-ID=29c6732d5d580cb7, has-quorum=true: https://192.168.60.11:2379 - 3.4.9 (Leader)
```

OK:
  The overall status. Either ``OK`` or ``Failure``.

1/1 connected:
  Number of total etcd endpoints and how many of them are reachable.

lease-ID:
  UUID of the lease used for all keys owned by this agent.

lock lease-ID:
  UUID of the lease used for locks acquired by this agent.

has-quorum:
  Status of etcd quorum. Either ``true`` or set to an error.

consecutive-errors:
  Number of consecutive quorum errors. Only printed if errors are present.

https://192.168.60.11:2379 - 3.4.9 (Leader):
  List of all etcd endpoints stating the etcd version and whether the
  particular endpoint is currently the elected leader. If an etcd endpoint
  cannot be reached, the error is shown.

<a id="etcd_recovery_behavior"></a>

### Recovery behavior

In the event of an etcd endpoint becoming unhealthy, etcd should automatically
resolve this by electing a new leader and by failing over to a healthy etcd
endpoint. As long as quorum is preserved, the etcd cluster will remain
functional.

In addition, Cilium performs a background check in an interval to determine
etcd health and potentially take action. The interval depends on the overall
cluster size. The larger the cluster, the longer the [interval](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cilium/cilium/pkg/kvstore?tab=doc#ExtraOptions.StatusCheckInterval):

 * If no etcd endpoints can be reached, Cilium will report failure in ``cilium-dbg
   status``. This will cause the liveness and readiness probe of Kubernetes to
   fail and Cilium will be restarted.

 * A lock is acquired and released to test a write operation which requires
   quorum. If this operation fails, loss of quorum is reported. If quorum fails
   for three or more intervals in a row, Cilium is declared unhealthy.

 * The Cilium operator will constantly write to a heartbeat key
   (``cilium/.heartbeat``). All Cilium agents will watch for updates to this
   heartbeat key. This validates the ability for an agent to receive key
   updates from etcd. If the heartbeat key is not updated in time, the quorum
   check is declared to have failed and Cilium is declared unhealthy after 3 or
   more consecutive failures.

Example of a status with a quorum failure which has not yet reached the
threshold:

```
KVStore: Ok   etcd: 1/1 connected, lease-ID=29c6732d5d580cb5, lock lease-ID=29c6732d5d580cb7, has-quorum=2m2.778966915s since last heartbeat update has been received, consecutive-errors=1: https://192.168.60.11:2379 - 3.4.9 (Leader)
```

Example of a status with the number of quorum failures exceeding the threshold:

```
KVStore: Failure   Err: quorum check failed 8 times in a row: 4m28.446600949s since last heartbeat update has been received
```

## Cluster Mesh Troubleshooting

### Install the Cilium CLI

.. include:: /installation/cli-download.rst

### Automatic Verification

 1. Validate that Cilium pods are healthy and ready:

```shell-session
cilium status
```

 1. Validate that Cluster Mesh is enabled and operational:

```shell-session
cilium clustermesh status
```

 1. In case of errors, run the troubleshoot command to automatically investigate
    Cilium agents connectivity issues towards the ClusterMesh control plane in
    remote clusters:

```shell-session
kubectl exec -it -n kube-system ds/cilium -c cilium-agent -- cilium-dbg troubleshoot clustermesh
```

    The troubleshoot command performs a set of automatic checks to validate
    DNS resolution, network connectivity, TLS authentication, etcd authorization
    and more, and reports the output in a user friendly format.

    When KVStoreMesh is enabled, the output of the troubleshoot command refers
    to the connections from the agents to the local cache, and it is expected to
    be the same for all the clusters they are connected to. Run the troubleshoot
    command inside the clustermesh-apiserver to investigate KVStoreMesh connectivity
    issues towards the ClusterMesh control plane in remote clusters:

```shell-session
kubectl exec -it -n kube-system deploy/clustermesh-apiserver -c kvstoremesh -- \
  clustermesh-apiserver kvstoremesh-dbg troubleshoot
```

> **Tip:**
> You can specify one or more cluster names as parameters of the troubleshoot
> command to run the checks only towards a subset of remote clusters.

### Manual Verification

As an alternative to leveraging the tools presented in the previous section,
you may perform the following steps to troubleshoot ClusterMesh issues.

 1. Validate that each cluster is assigned a **unique** human-readable name as well
    as a numeric cluster ID (1-255).

 1. Validate that the clustermesh-apiserver is initialized correctly for each cluster:

```shell-session
$ kubectl logs -n kube-system deployment/clustermesh-apiserver -c apiserver
...
level=info msg="Connecting to etcd server..." config=/var/lib/cilium/etcd-config.yaml endpoints="[https://127.0.0.1:2379]" subsys=kvstore
level=info msg="Got lock lease ID 7c0281854b945c07" subsys=kvstore
level=info msg="Initial etcd session established" config=/var/lib/cilium/etcd-config.yaml endpoints="[https://127.0.0.1:2379]" subsys=kvstore
level=info msg="Successfully verified version of etcd endpoint" config=/var/lib/cilium/etcd-config.yaml endpoints="[https://127.0.0.1:2379]" etcdEndpoint="https://127.0.0.1:2379" subsys=kvstore version=3.4.13
```

 1. Validate that ClusterMesh is healthy running ``cilium-dbg status --all-clusters`` inside each Cilium agent:

```
    ClusterMesh:   1/1 remote clusters ready, 10 global-services
       k8s-c2: ready, 3 nodes, 25 endpoints, 8 identities, 10 services, 0 reconnections (last: never)
       └  etcd: 1/1 connected, leases=0, lock lease-ID=7c028201b53de662, has-quorum=true: https://k8s-c2.mesh.cilium.io:2379 - 3.5.4 (Leader)
       └  remote configuration: expected=true, retrieved=true, cluster-id=3, kvstoremesh=false, sync-canaries=true
       └  synchronization status: nodes=true, endpoints=true, identities=true, services=true

When KVStoreMesh is enabled, additionally check its status and validate that
it is correctly connected to all remote clusters:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  $ kubectl --context $CLUSTER1 exec -it -n kube-system deploy/clustermesh-apiserver \
      -c kvstoremesh -- clustermesh-apiserver kvstoremesh-dbg status --verbose
```

 1. Validate that the required TLS secrets are set up properly. By default, the
    following TLS secrets must be available in the namespace in which Cilium is
    installed:

    * ``clustermesh-apiserver-server-cert``, which is used by the etcd container
      in the clustermesh-apiserver deployment. Not applicable if an external etcd
      cluster is used.

    * ``clustermesh-apiserver-admin-cert``, which is used by the apiserver/kvstoremesh
      containers in the clustermesh-apiserver deployment, to authenticate against the
      sidecar etcd instance. Not applicable if an external etcd cluster is used.

    * ``clustermesh-apiserver-remote-cert``, which is used by Cilium agents, and
      optionally the kvstoremesh container in the clustermesh-apiserver deployment,
      to authenticate against remote etcd instances (either internal or external).

    * ``clustermesh-apiserver-local-cert``, which is used by Cilium agents to
      authenticate against the local etcd instance. Only applicable if KVStoreMesh
      is enabled.

 1. Validate that the configuration for remote clusters is picked up correctly.
    For each remote cluster, an info log message ``New remote cluster
    configuration`` along with the remote cluster name must be logged in the
    ``cilium-agent`` logs.

    If the configuration is not found, check the following:

    * The ``cilium-clustermesh`` Kubernetes secret is present and correctly
      mounted by the Cilium agent pods.

    * The secret contains a file for each remote cluster with the filename matching
      the name of the remote cluster as provided by the ``--cluster-name`` argument
      or the ``cluster-name`` ConfigMap option.

    * Each file named after a remote cluster contains a valid etcd configuration
      consisting of the endpoints to reach the remote etcd cluster, and the path
      of the certificate and private key to authenticate against that etcd cluster.
      Additional files may be included in the secret to provide the certificate
      and private key themselves.

    * The ``/var/lib/cilium/clustermesh`` directory inside any of the Cilium agent
      pods contains the files mounted from the ``cilium-clustermesh`` secret.
      You can use
      ``kubectl exec -ti -n kube-system ds/cilium -c cilium-agent -- ls /var/lib/cilium/clustermesh``
      to list the files present.

 1. Validate that the connection to the remote cluster could be established.
    You will see a log message like this in the ``cilium-agent`` logs for each
    remote cluster:

```
level=info msg="Connection to remote cluster established"
```

    If the connection failed, you will see a warning like this:

```
level=warning msg="Unable to establish etcd connection to remote cluster"
```

    If the connection fails, check the following:

    * When KVStoreMesh is disabled, validate that the ``hostAliases`` section in the Cilium DaemonSet maps
      each remote cluster to the IP of the LoadBalancer that makes the remote
      control plane available; When KVStoreMesh is enabled,
      validate the ``hostAliases`` section in the clustermesh-apiserver Deployment.

    * Validate that a local node in the source cluster can reach the IP
      specified in the ``hostAliases`` section. When KVStoreMesh is disabled, the ``cilium-clustermesh``
      secret contains a configuration file for each remote cluster, it will
      point to a logical name representing the remote cluster;
      When KVStoreMesh is enabled, it exists in the ``cilium-kvstoremesh`` secret.

```yaml
endpoints:
- https://cluster1.mesh.cilium.io:2379
```

      The name will *NOT* be resolvable via DNS outside the Cilium agent pods.
      The name is mapped to an IP using ``hostAliases``. Run ``kubectl -n
      kube-system get daemonset cilium -o yaml`` when KVStoreMesh is disabled,
      or run ``kubectl -n kube-system get deployment clustermesh-apiserver -o yaml`` when KVStoreMesh is enabled,
      grep for the FQDN to retrieve the IP that is configured. Then use ``curl`` to validate that the port is
      reachable.

    * A firewall between the local cluster and the remote cluster may drop the
      control plane connection. Ensure that port 2379/TCP is allowed.

### State Propagation

 1. Run ``cilium-dbg node list`` in one of the Cilium pods and validate that it
    lists both local nodes and nodes from remote clusters. If remote nodes are
    not present, validate that Cilium agents (or KVStoreMesh, if enabled)
    are correctly connected to the given remote cluster. Additionally, verify
    that the initial nodes synchronization from all clusters has completed.

 1. Validate the connectivity health matrix across clusters by running
    ``cilium-health status`` inside any Cilium pod. It will list the status of
    the connectivity health check to each remote node. If this fails, make sure
    that the network allows the health checking traffic as specified in the
    [firewall_requirements](system_requirements.md#firewall_requirements) section.

 1. Validate that identities are synchronized correctly by running ``cilium-dbg
    identity list`` in one of the Cilium pods. It must list identities from all
    clusters. You can determine what cluster an identity belongs to by looking
    at the label ``io.cilium.k8s.policy.cluster``. If remote identities are
    not present, validate that Cilium agents (or KVStoreMesh, if enabled)
    are correctly connected to the given remote cluster. Additionally, verify
    that the initial identities synchronization from all clusters has completed.

 1. Validate that the IP cache is synchronized correctly by running ``cilium-dbg
    bpf ipcache list`` or ``cilium-dbg map get cilium_ipcache``. The output must
    contain pod IPs from local and remote clusters. If remote IP addresses are
    not present, validate that Cilium agents (or KVStoreMesh, if enabled)
    are correctly connected to the given remote cluster. Additionally, verify
    that the initial IPs synchronization from all clusters has completed.

 1. When using global services, ensure that global services are configured with
    endpoints from all clusters. Run ``cilium-dbg service list`` in any Cilium pod
    and validate that the backend IPs consist of pod IPs from all clusters
    running relevant backends. You can further validate the correct datapath
    plumbing by running ``cilium-dbg bpf lb list`` to inspect the state of the eBPF
    maps.

    If this fails:

    * Run ``cilium-dbg debuginfo`` and look for the section ``k8s-service-cache``. In
      that section, you will find the contents of the service correlation
      cache. It will list the Kubernetes services and endpoints of the local
      cluster.  It will also have a section ``externalEndpoints`` which must
      list all endpoints of remote clusters.

      :

```
#### k8s-service-cache

(*k8s.ServiceCache)(0xc00000c500)({
[...]
 services: (map[k8s.ServiceID]*k8s.Service) (len=2) {
   (k8s.ServiceID) default/kubernetes: (*k8s.Service)(0xc000cd11d0)(frontend:172.20.0.1/ports=[https]/selector=map[]),
   (k8s.ServiceID) kube-system/kube-dns: (*k8s.Service)(0xc000cd1220)(frontend:172.20.0.10/ports=[metrics dns dns-tcp]/selector=map[k8s-app:kube-dns])
 },
 endpoints: (map[k8s.ServiceID]*k8s.Endpoints) (len=2) {
   (k8s.ServiceID) kube-system/kube-dns: (*k8s.Endpoints)(0xc0000103c0)(10.16.127.105:53/TCP,10.16.127.105:53/UDP,10.16.127.105:9153/TCP),
   (k8s.ServiceID) default/kubernetes: (*k8s.Endpoints)(0xc0000103f8)(192.168.60.11:6443/TCP)
 },
 externalEndpoints: (map[k8s.ServiceID]k8s.externalEndpoints) {
 }
})
```

      The sections ``services`` and ``endpoints`` represent the services of the
      local cluster, the section ``externalEndpoints`` lists all remote
      services and will be correlated with services matching the same
      ``ServiceID``.

## Service Mesh Troubleshooting

### Install the Cilium CLI

.. include:: /installation/cli-download.rst

### Generic

 1. Validate that the ``ds/cilium`` as well as the ``deployment/cilium-operator`` pods
    are healthy and ready.

```shell-session
$ cilium status
```

### Manual Verification of Setup

 1. Validate that ``nodePort.enabled`` is true.

```shell-session
$ kubectl exec -n kube-system ds/cilium -- cilium-dbg status --verbose
...
KubeProxyReplacement Details:
...
  Services:
  - ClusterIP:      Enabled
  - NodePort:       Enabled (Range: 30000-32767)
...
```

 1. Validate that runtime the values of ``enable-envoy-config`` and ``enable-ingress-controller``
    are true. Ingress controller flag is optional if customer only uses ``CiliumEnvoyConfig`` or
    ``CiliumClusterwideEnvoyConfig`` CRDs.

```shell-session
$ kubectl -n kube-system get cm cilium-config -o json | egrep "enable-ingress-controller|enable-envoy-config"
        "enable-envoy-config": "true",
        "enable-ingress-controller": "true",
```

### Ingress Troubleshooting

Internally, the Cilium Ingress controller will create one Load Balancer service, one
``CiliumEnvoyConfig`` and one dummy Endpoint resource for each Ingress resource.

```shell-session
$ kubectl get ingress
NAME            CLASS    HOSTS   ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE
basic-ingress   cilium   *       10.97.60.117   80      16m

# For dedicated Load Balancer mode
$ kubectl get service cilium-ingress-basic-ingress
NAME                           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
cilium-ingress-basic-ingress   LoadBalancer   10.97.60.117   10.97.60.117   80:31911/TCP   17m

# For dedicated Load Balancer mode
$ kubectl get cec cilium-ingress-default-basic-ingress
NAME                                   AGE
cilium-ingress-default-basic-ingress   18m

# For shared Load Balancer mode
$ kubectl get services -n kube-system cilium-ingress
NAME             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE
cilium-ingress   LoadBalancer   10.111.109.99   10.111.109.99   80:32690/TCP,443:31566/TCP   38m

# For shared Load Balancer mode
$ kubectl get cec -n kube-system cilium-ingress
NAME             AGE
cilium-ingress   15m
```

 1. Validate that the Load Balancer service has either an external IP or FQDN assigned.
    If it's not available after a long time, please check the Load Balancer related
    documentation from your respective cloud provider.

 1. Check if there is any warning or error message while Cilium is trying to provision
    the ``CiliumEnvoyConfig`` resource. This is unlikely to happen for CEC resources
    originating from the Cilium Ingress controller.

.. include:: /network/servicemesh/warning.rst

### Connectivity Troubleshooting

This section is for troubleshooting connectivity issues mainly for Ingress resources, but
the same steps can be applied to manually configured ``CiliumEnvoyConfig`` resources as well.

It's best to have ``debug`` and ``debug-verbose`` enabled with below values. Kindly
note that any change of Cilium flags requires a restart of the Cilium agent and operator.

```shell-session
$ kubectl get -n kube-system cm cilium-config -o json | grep "debug"
        "debug": "true",
        "debug-verbose": "flow",
```

> **Note:**
> The originating source IP is used for enforcing ingress traffic.

The request normally traverses from LoadBalancer service to pre-assigned port of your
node, then gets forwarded to the Cilium Envoy proxy, and finally gets proxied to the actual
backend service.

 1. The first step between cloud Load Balancer to node port is out of Cilium scope. Please
    check related documentation from your respective cloud provider to make sure your
    clusters are configured properly.

 1. The second step could be checked by connecting with SSH to your underlying host, and
    sending the similar request to localhost on the relevant port:

```shell-session
$ kubectl get service cilium-ingress-basic-ingress
NAME                           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
cilium-ingress-basic-ingress   LoadBalancer   10.97.60.117   10.97.60.117   80:31911/TCP   17m

# After ssh to any of k8s node
$ curl -v http://localhost:31911/
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:31911...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 31911 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:31911
> User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
> Accept: */*
>
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
< content-length: 19
< content-type: text/plain
< date: Thu, 07 Jul 2022 12:25:56 GMT
< server: envoy
<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact

# Flows for world identity
$ kubectl -n kube-system exec ds/cilium -- hubble observe -f --identity 2
Jul  7 12:28:27.970: 127.0.0.1:54704 <- 127.0.0.1:13681 http-response FORWARDED (HTTP/1.1 503 0ms (GET http://localhost:31911/))
```

    Alternatively, you can also send a request directly to the Envoy proxy port. For
    Ingress, the proxy port is randomly assigned by the Cilium Ingress controller. For
    manually configured ``CiliumEnvoyConfig`` resources, the proxy port is retrieved
    directly from the spec.

```shell-session
$  kubectl logs -f -n kube-system ds/cilium --timestamps | egrep "envoy|proxy"
...
2022-07-08T08:05:13.986649816Z level=info msg="Adding new proxy port rules for cilium-ingress-default-basic-ingress:19672" proxy port name=cilium-ingress-default-basic-ingress subsys=proxy

# After ssh to any of k8s node, send request to Envoy proxy port directly
$ curl -v  http://localhost:19672
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:19672...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 19672 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:19672
> User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
> Accept: */*
>
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
< content-length: 19
< content-type: text/plain
< date: Fri, 08 Jul 2022 08:12:35 GMT
< server: envoy
```

    If you see a response similar to the above, it means that the request is being
    redirected to proxy successfully. The http response will have one special header
    ``server: envoy`` accordingly. The same can be observed from ``hubble observe``
    command [hubble_troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#hubble_troubleshooting).

    The most common root cause is either that the Cilium Envoy proxy is not running
    on the node, or there is some other issue with CEC resource provisioning.

```shell-session
$ kubectl exec -n kube-system ds/cilium -- cilium-dbg status
...
Controller Status:       49/49 healthy
Proxy Status:            OK, ip 10.0.0.25, 6 redirects active on ports 10000-20000
Global Identity Range:   min 256, max 65535
```

 1. Assuming that the above steps are done successfully, you can proceed to send a request via
    an external IP or via FQDN next.

    Double-check whether your backend service is up and healthy. The Envoy Discovery Service
    (EDS) has a name that follows the convention ``<namespace>/<service-name>:<port>``.

```shell-session
$ LB_IP=$(kubectl get ingress basic-ingress -o json | jq '.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip' | jq -r .)
$ curl -s http://$LB_IP/details/1
no healthy upstream

$ kubectl get cec cilium-ingress-default-basic-ingress -o json | jq '.spec.resources[] | select(.type=="EDS")'
{
  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.cluster.v3.Cluster",
  "connectTimeout": "5s",
  "name": "default/details:9080",
  "outlierDetection": {
    "consecutiveLocalOriginFailure": 2,
    "splitExternalLocalOriginErrors": true
  },
  "type": "EDS",
  "typedExtensionProtocolOptions": {
    "envoy.extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions": {
      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions",
      "useDownstreamProtocolConfig": {
        "http2ProtocolOptions": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
{
  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.cluster.v3.Cluster",
  "connectTimeout": "5s",
  "name": "default/productpage:9080",
  "outlierDetection": {
    "consecutiveLocalOriginFailure": 2,
    "splitExternalLocalOriginErrors": true
  },
  "type": "EDS",
  "typedExtensionProtocolOptions": {
    "envoy.extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions": {
      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions",
      "useDownstreamProtocolConfig": {
        "http2ProtocolOptions": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

    If everything is configured correctly, you will be able to see the flows from ``world`` (identity 2),
    ``ingress`` (identity 8) and your backend pod as per below.

```shell-session

## Symptom Library

### Node to node traffic is being dropped

#### Symptom

Endpoint to endpoint communication on a single node succeeds but communication
fails between endpoints across multiple nodes.

#### Troubleshooting steps:

1. Run ``cilium-health status`` on the node of the source and destination
   endpoint. It should describe the connectivity from that node to other
   nodes in the cluster, and to a simulated endpoint on each other node.
   Identify points in the cluster that cannot talk to each other. If the
   command does not describe the status of the other node, there may be an
   issue with the KV-Store.

1. Run ``cilium-dbg monitor`` on the node of the source and destination endpoint.
   Look for packet drops.

   When running in [arch_overlay](../network/concepts/routing.md#arch_overlay) mode:

1. Run ``cilium-dbg bpf tunnel list`` and verify that each Cilium node is aware of
   the other nodes in the cluster.  If not, check the logfile for errors.

1. If nodes are being populated correctly, run ``tcpdump -n -i cilium_vxlan`` on
   each node to verify whether cross node traffic is being forwarded correctly
   between nodes.

   If packets are being dropped,

   * verify that the node IP listed in ``cilium-dbg bpf tunnel list`` can reach each
     other.
   * verify that the firewall on each node allows UDP port 8472.

   When running in [arch_direct_routing](../network/concepts/routing.md#arch_direct_routing) mode:

1. Run ``ip route`` or check your cloud provider router and verify that you have
   routes installed to route the endpoint prefix between all nodes.

1. Verify that the firewall on each node permits to route the endpoint IPs.

## Useful Scripts

<a id="retrieve_cilium_pod"></a>

### Retrieve Cilium pod managing a particular pod

Identifies the Cilium pod that is managing a particular pod in a namespace:

```shell-session
k8s-get-cilium-pod.sh <pod> <namespace>
```

**Example:**

```shell-session
$ curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cilium/cilium/main/contrib/k8s/k8s-get-cilium-pod.sh
$ chmod +x k8s-get-cilium-pod.sh
$ ./k8s-get-cilium-pod.sh luke-pod default
cilium-zmjj9
cilium-node-init-v7r9p
cilium-operator-f576f7977-s5gpq
```

### Execute a command in all Kubernetes Cilium pods

Run a command within all Cilium pods of a cluster

```shell-session
k8s-cilium-exec.sh <command>
```

**Example:**

```shell-session
$ curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cilium/cilium/main/contrib/k8s/k8s-cilium-exec.sh
$ chmod +x k8s-cilium-exec.sh
$ ./k8s-cilium-exec.sh uptime
 10:15:16 up 6 days,  7:37,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.02, 0.00
 10:15:16 up 6 days,  7:32,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.03, 0.04
 10:15:16 up 6 days,  7:30,  0 users,  load average: 0.75, 0.27, 0.15
 10:15:16 up 6 days,  7:28,  0 users,  load average: 0.14, 0.04, 0.01
```

### List unmanaged Kubernetes pods

Lists all Kubernetes pods in the cluster for which Cilium does *not* provide
networking. This includes pods running in host-networking mode and pods that
were started before Cilium was deployed.

```shell-session
k8s-unmanaged.sh
```

**Example:**

```shell-session
$ curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cilium/cilium/main/contrib/k8s/k8s-unmanaged.sh

### Automatic log & state collection

Included file `Documentation/installation/cli-download.rst`:

> **Warning:**
> Make sure you install [cilium-cli v0.15.0](https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli/releases/tag/v0.15.0)
> or later. The rest of instructions do not work with older versions of
> cilium-cli. To confirm the cilium-cli version that's installed in your system,
> run:
>
> ```shell-session
> cilium version --client
> ```
>
> See [Cilium CLI upgrade notes](upgrade.md#upgrade_cilium_cli_helm_mode) for more details.

Install the latest version of the Cilium CLI. The Cilium CLI can be used to
install Cilium, inspect the state of a Cilium installation, and enable/disable
various features (e.g. clustermesh, Hubble).

.. only:: not stable

   Clone the Cilium GitHub repository so that the Cilium CLI can access the
   latest unreleased Helm chart from the main branch:

   .. parsed-literal::

      git clone git@github.com:cilium/cilium.git
      cd cilium

Then, execute ``cilium sysdump`` command to collect troubleshooting information
from your Kubernetes cluster:

```shell-session
cilium sysdump
```

Note that by default ``cilium sysdump`` will attempt to collect as much logs as
possible and for all the nodes in the cluster. If your cluster size is above 20
nodes, consider setting the following options to limit the size of the sysdump.
This is not required, but useful for those who have a constraint on bandwidth or
upload size.

* set the ``--node-list`` option to pick only a few nodes in case the cluster has
  many of them.
* set the ``--logs-since-time`` option to go back in time to when the issues started.
* set the ``--logs-limit-bytes`` option to limit the size of the log files (note:
  passed onto ``kubectl logs``; does not apply to entire collection archive).

Ideally, a sysdump that has a full history of select nodes, rather than a brief
history of all the nodes, would be preferred (by using ``--node-list``). The second
recommended way would be to use ``--logs-since-time`` if you are able to narrow down
when the issues started. Lastly, if the Cilium agent and Operator logs are too
large, consider ``--logs-limit-bytes``.

Use ``--help`` to see more options:

```shell-session
cilium sysdump --help
```

#### Single Node Bugtool

If you are not running Kubernetes, it is also possible to run the bug
collection tool manually with the scope of a single node:

The ``cilium-bugtool`` captures potentially useful information about your
environment for debugging. The tool is meant to be used for debugging a single
Cilium agent node. In the Kubernetes case, if you have multiple Cilium pods,
the tool can retrieve debugging information from all of them. The tool works by
archiving a collection of command output and files from several places. By
default, it writes to the ``tmp`` directory.

Note that the command needs to be run from inside the Cilium pod/container.

```shell-session
cilium-bugtool
```

When running it with no option as shown above, it will try to copy various
files and execute some commands. If ``kubectl`` is detected, it will search for
Cilium pods. The default label being ``k8s-app=cilium``, but this and the
namespace can be changed via ``k8s-namespace`` and ``k8s-label`` respectively.

If you want to capture the archive from a Kubernetes pod, then the process is a
bit different

```shell-session
$ # First we need to get the Cilium pod
$ kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system
NAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cilium-kg8lv                  1/1       Running   0          13m
kube-addon-manager-minikube   1/1       Running   0          1h
kube-dns-6fc954457d-sf2nk     3/3       Running   0          1h
kubernetes-dashboard-6xvc7    1/1       Running   0          1h

$ # Run the bugtool from this pod
$ kubectl -n kube-system exec cilium-kg8lv -- cilium-bugtool
[...]

$ # Copy the archive from the pod
$ kubectl cp kube-system/cilium-kg8lv:/tmp/cilium-bugtool-20180411-155146.166+0000-UTC-266836983.tar /tmp/cilium-bugtool-20180411-155146.166+0000-UTC-266836983.tar
[...]
```

> **Note:**
> Please check the archive for sensitive information and strip it
> away before sharing it with us.

Below is an approximate list of the kind of information in the archive.

* Cilium status
* Cilium version
* Kernel configuration
* Resolve configuration
* Cilium endpoint state
* Cilium logs
* Docker logs
* ``dmesg``
* ``ethtool``
* ``ip a``
* ``ip link``
* ``ip r``
* ``iptables-save``
* ``kubectl -n kube-system get pods``
* ``kubectl get pods,svc for all namespaces``
* ``uname``
* ``uptime``
* ``cilium-dbg bpf * list``
* ``cilium-dbg endpoint get for each endpoint``
* ``cilium-dbg endpoint list``
* ``hostname``
* ``cilium-dbg policy get``
* ``cilium-dbg service list``

#### Debugging information

If you are not running Kubernetes, you can use the ``cilium-dbg debuginfo`` command
to retrieve useful debugging information. If you are running Kubernetes, this
command is automatically run as part of the system dump.

``cilium-dbg debuginfo`` can print useful output from the Cilium API. The output
format is in Markdown format so this can be used when reporting a bug on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues).  Running without arguments will print to standard output, but
you can also redirect to a file like

```shell-session
cilium-dbg debuginfo -f debuginfo.md
```

> **Note:**
> Please check the debuginfo file for sensitive information and strip it
> away before sharing it with us.

### Slack assistance

The Cilium Slack <!-- unresolved-rst-link: kind=named target=Cilium Slack --> community is a helpful first point of assistance to get
help troubleshooting a problem or to discuss options on how to address a
problem. The community is open to anyone.

### Report an issue via GitHub

If you believe to have found an issue in Cilium, please report a
GitHub issue <!-- unresolved-rst-link: kind=named target=GitHub issue --> and make sure to attach a system dump as described above to
ensure that developers have the best chance to reproduce the issue.
