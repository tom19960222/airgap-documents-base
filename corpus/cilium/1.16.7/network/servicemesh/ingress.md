# Kubernetes Ingress Support

Cilium uses the standard [Kubernetes Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) resource definition, with
an ``ingressClassName`` of ``cilium``. This can be used for path-based
routing and for TLS termination. For backwards compatibility, the
``kubernetes.io/ingress.class`` annotation with value of ``cilium``
is also supported.

> **Note:**
> The ingress controller creates a Service of LoadBalancer type, so
> your environment will need to support this.

Cilium allows you to specify load balancer mode for the Ingress resource:

- ``dedicated``: The Ingress controller will create a dedicated loadbalancer
  for the Ingress.
- ``shared``: The Ingress controller will use a shared loadbalancer for all
  Ingress resources.

Each load balancer mode has its own benefits and drawbacks. The shared mode saves
resources by sharing a single LoadBalancer config across all Ingress resources in
the cluster, while the dedicated mode can help to avoid potential conflicts (e.g.
path prefix) between resources.

> **Note:**
> It is possible to change the load balancer mode for an Ingress resource.
> When the mode is changed, active connections to backends of the Ingress
> may be terminated during the reconfiguration due to a new load balancer
> IP address being assigned to the Ingress resource.

This is a step-by-step guide on how to enable the Ingress Controller in
an existing K8s cluster with Cilium installed.

## Prerequisites

* Cilium must be configured with NodePort enabled, using
  ``nodePort.enabled=true`` or by enabling the kube-proxy replacement with
  ``kubeProxyReplacement=true``. For more information, see [kube-proxy replacement](../kubernetes/kubeproxy-free.md#kubeproxy-free).
* Cilium must be configured with the L7 proxy enabled using ``l7Proxy=true``
  (enabled by default).
* By default, the Ingress controller creates a Service of LoadBalancer type,
  so your environment will need to support this. Alternatively, you can change
  this to NodePort or, since Cilium 1.16+, directly expose the Cilium L7 proxy
  on the [host network](ingress.md#gs_ingress_host_network_mode).

## Installation

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Helm

       Cilium Ingress Controller can be enabled with helm flag ``ingressController.enabled``
       set as true. Please refer to [k8s_install_helm](../../installation/k8s-install-helm.md#k8s_install_helm) for a fresh installation.

       .. parsed-literal::

           $ helm upgrade cilium |CHART_RELEASE| \\
               --namespace kube-system \\
               --reuse-values \\
               --set ingressController.enabled=true \\
               --set ingressController.loadbalancerMode=dedicated
           $ kubectl -n kube-system rollout restart deployment/cilium-operator
           $ kubectl -n kube-system rollout restart ds/cilium

       Cilium can become the default ingress controller by setting the
       ``--set ingressController.default=true`` flag. This will create ingress entries even when the ``ingressClass``
       is not set.

       If you only want to use envoy traffic management feature without Ingress support, you should only
       enable ``--enable-envoy-config`` flag.

       .. parsed-literal::

           $ helm upgrade cilium |CHART_RELEASE| \\
               --namespace kube-system \\
               --reuse-values \\
               --set envoyConfig.enabled=true
           $ kubectl -n kube-system rollout restart deployment/cilium-operator
           $ kubectl -n kube-system rollout restart ds/cilium

       Additionally, the proxy load-balancing feature can be configured with the ``loadBalancer.l7.backend=envoy`` flag.

       .. parsed-literal::
           $ helm upgrade cilium |CHART_RELEASE| \\
               --namespace kube-system \\
               --reuse-values \\
               --set loadBalancer.l7.backend=envoy
           $ kubectl -n kube-system rollout restart deployment/cilium-operator
           $ kubectl -n kube-system rollout restart ds/cilium

       Next you can check the status of the Cilium agent and operator:

       .. code-block:: shell-session

           $ cilium status

       .. include:: ../../installation/cli-download.rst

   .. group-tab:: Cilium CLI

       .. include:: ../../installation/cli-download.rst

       Cilium Ingress Controller can be enabled with the below command

       .. parsed-literal::

           $ cilium install |CHART_VERSION| \
               --set kubeProxyReplacement=true \
               --set ingressController.enabled=true \
               --set ingressController.loadbalancerMode=dedicated

       Cilium can become the default ingress controller by setting the
       ``--set ingressController.default=true`` flag. This will create ingress entries even when the ``ingressClass``
       is not set.

       If you only want to use envoy traffic management feature without Ingress support, you should only
       enable ``--enable-envoy-config`` flag.

       .. parsed-literal::

           $ cilium install |CHART_VERSION| \
               --set kubeProxyReplacement=true \
               --set envoyConfig.enabled=true

       Additionally, the proxy load-balancing feature can be configured with the ``loadBalancer.l7.backend=envoy`` flag.

       .. parsed-literal::

           $ cilium install |CHART_VERSION| \
               --set kubeProxyReplacement=true \
               --set envoyConfig.enabled=true \
               --set loadBalancer.l7.backend=envoy

       Next you can check the status of the Cilium agent and operator:

       .. code-block:: shell-session

           $ cilium status

It is also recommended that you [install Hubble CLI](../../observability/hubble/setup.md#hubble_cli_install)
which will be used used to observe the traffic in later steps.

## Reference

### How Cilium Ingress and Gateway API differ from other Ingress controllers

One of the biggest differences between Cilium's Ingress and Gateway API support
and other Ingress controllers is how closely tied the implementation is to the
CNI. For Cilium, Ingress and Gateway API are part of the networking stack,
and so behave in a different way to other Ingress or Gateway API controllers
(even other Ingress or Gateway API controllers running in a Cilium cluster).

Other Ingress or Gateway API controllers are generally installed as a Deployment
or Daemonset in the cluster, and exposed via a Loadbalancer Service or similar (which Cilium
can, of course, enable).

Cilium's Ingress and Gateway API config is exposed with a Loadbalancer or NodePort
service, or optionally can be exposed on the Host network also. But in all of
these cases, when traffic arrives at the Service's port, eBPF code intercepts
the traffic and transparently forwards it to Envoy (using the TPROXY kernel facility).

This affects things like client IP visibility, which works differently for Cilium's
Ingress and Gateway API support to other Ingress controllers.

It also allows Cilium's Network Policy engine to apply CiliumNetworkPolicy to
traffic bound for and traffic coming from an Ingress.

### Cilium's ingress config and CiliumNetworkPolicy

Ingress and Gateway API traffic bound to backend services via Cilium passes through a
per-node Envoy proxy.

The per-node Envoy proxy has special code that allows it to interact with the
eBPF policy engine, and do policy lookups on traffic. This allows Envoy to be
a Network Policy enforcement point, both for Ingress (and Gateway API) traffic,
and also for east-west traffic via GAMMA or L7 Traffic Management.

However, for ingress config, there's also an additional step. Traffic that arrives at
Envoy *for Ingress or Gateway API* is assigned the special ``ingress`` identity
in Cilium's Policy engine.

Traffic coming from outside the cluster is usually assigned the ``world`` identity
(unless there are IP CIDR policies in the cluster). This means that there are
actually *two* logical Policy enforcement points in Cilium Ingress - before traffic
arrives at the ``ingress`` identity, and after, when it is about to exit the
per-node Envoy.

![](/images/ingress-policy.png)

This means that, when applying Network Policy to a cluster, it's important to
ensure that both steps are allowed, and that traffic is allowed from ``world`` to
``ingress``, and from ``ingress`` to identities in the cluster (like the
``productpage`` identity in the image above).

Please see the [gs_ingress_and_network_policy](ingress-and-network-policy.md#gs_ingress_and_network_policy) for more details for Ingress,
although the same principles also apply for Gateway API.

### Source IP Visibility

> **Note:**
> By default, source IP visibility for Cilium ingress config, both Ingress
> and Gateway API, should *just work* on most installations. Read this section
> for more information on requirements and relevant settings.

Having a backend be able to deduce what IP address the actual request came from
is important for most applications.

By default, Cilium's Envoy instances are configured to append the visible source
address of incoming HTTP connections to the ``X-Forwarded-For`` header, using the
usual rules. That is, by default Cilium sets the number of trusted hops to ``0``,
indicating that Envoy should use the address the connection is opened from, rather
than a value inside the ``X-Forwarded-For`` list. Increasing this count will
have Envoy use the ``n`` th value from the list, counting from the right.

Envoy will also set the ``X-Envoy-External-Address`` header to the trusted client
address, whatever that turns out to be, based on ``X-Forwarded-For``.

> **Note:**
> Backends using Cilium ingress (whether via Ingress or Gateway API) should
> just see the ``X-Forwarded-For`` and ``X-Envoy-External-Address`` headers (which
> are handled transparently by many HTTP libraries).

#### ``externalTrafficPolicy`` for Loadbalancer or NodePort Services

Cilium's ingress support (both for Ingress and Gateway API) often uses a Loadbalancer
or NodePort Service to expose the Envoy Daemonset.

In these cases, the Service object has one field that is particularly relevant
to Client IP visibility - the ``externalTrafficPolicy`` field.

It has two relevant settings:

- ``Local``: Nodes will only route traffic to Pods running on the local node,
  *without masquerading the source IP*. Because of this, in clusters that use
  ``kube-proxy``, this is the only way to ensure source IP visibility. Part of
  the contract for ``externalTrafficPolicy`` local is also that the node will
  open a port (the ``healthCheckNodePort``, automatically set by Kubernetes when
  ``externalTrafficPolicy: Local`` is set), and requests to
  ``http://<nodeIP>:<healthCheckNodePort>/healthz`` will return 200 on nodes that
  have local pods running, and non-200 on nodes that don't. Cilium implements this
  for general Loadbalancer Services, but it's a bit different for Cilium ingress
  config (both Ingress and Gateway API).
- ``Cluster``: Node will route to all endpoints across the cluster evenly. This
  has a couple of other effects: Firstly, upstream loadbalancers will expect to
  be able to send traffic to any node and have it end up at a backend Pod, and
  the node *may* masquerade the source IP. This means that in many cases,
  ``externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster`` may mean that the backend pod does *not* see
  the source IP.

In Cilium's case, all ingress traffic bound for a Service that exposes Envoy is
*always* going to the local node, and is *always* forwarded to Envoy using the
Linux Kernel TPROXY function, which transparently forwards packets to the backend.

This means that for Cilium ingress config, for both Ingress and Gateway API, things
work a little differently in both ``externalTrafficPolicy`` cases.

> **Note:**
> In *both* ``externalTrafficPolicy`` cases, traffic will arrive at any node
> in the cluster, and be forwarded to *Envoy* **while keeping the source IP intact**.

Also, for any Services that exposes Cilium's Envoy, Cilium will ensure that
when ``externalTrafficPolicy: Local`` is set, every node in the cluster will
pass the ``healthCheckNodePort`` check, so that external load balancers will
forward correctly.

However, for Cilium's ingress config, both Ingress and Gateway API, **it is not
necessary** to configure ``externalTrafficPolicy: Local`` to keep the source IP
visible to the backend pod (via the ``X-Forwarded-For`` and ``X-Envoy-External-Address``
fields).

#### TLS Passthrough and source IP visibility

Both Ingress and Gateway API support TLS Passthrough configuration (via annotation
for Ingress, and the TLSRoute resource for Gateway API). This configuration allows
multiple TLS Passthrough backends to share the same TLS port on a loadbalancer,
with Envoy inspecting the Server Name Indicator (SNI) field of the TLS handshake,
and using that to forward the TLS stream to a backend.

However, this poses problems for source IP visibility, because Envoy is doing a
TCP Proxy of the TLS stream.

What happens is that the TLS traffic arrives at Envoy, terminating a TCP stream,
Envoy inspects the client hello to find the SNI, picks a backend to forward to,
then starts a new TCP stream and forwards the TLS traffic inside the downstream
(outside)  packets to the upstream (the backend).

Because it's a new TCP stream, as far as the backends are concerned, the source
IP is Envoy (which is often the Node IP, depending on your Cilium config).

> **Note:**
> When doing TLS Passthrough, backends will see Cilium Envoy's IP address
> as the source of the forwarded TLS streams.

### Ingress Path Types and Precedence

The Ingress specification supports three types of paths:

* **Exact** - match the given path exactly.
* **Prefix** - match the URL path prefix split by ``/``. The last path segment must
  match the whole segment - if you configure a Prefix path of ``/foo/bar``,
  ``/foo/bar/baz`` will match, but ``/foo/barbaz`` will not.
* **ImplementationSpecific** - Interpretation of the Path is up to the IngressClass.
  **In Cilium's case, we define ImplementationSpecific to be "Regex"**, so Cilium will
  interpret any given path as a regular expression and program Envoy accordingly.
  Notably, some other implementations have ImplementationSpecific mean "Prefix",
  and in those cases, Cilium will treat the paths differently. (Since a path like
  ``/foo/bar`` contains no regex characters, when it is configured in Envoy as a
  regex, it will function as an ``Exact`` match instead).

When multiple path types are configured on an Ingress object, Cilium will configure
Envoy with the matches in the following order:

1. Exact
1. ImplementationSpecific (that is, regular expression)
1. Prefix
1. The ``/`` Prefix match has special handling and always goes last.

Within each of these path types, the paths are sorted in decreasing order of string
length.

If you do use ImplementationSpecific regex support, be careful with using the
``*`` operator, since it will increase the length of the regex, but may match
another, shorter option.

For example, if you have two ImplementationSpecific paths, ``/impl``, and ``/impl.*``,
the second will be sorted ahead of the first in the generated config. But because
``*`` is in use, the ``/impl`` match will never be hit, as any request to that
path will match the ``/impl.*`` path first.

See the [Ingress Path Types](path-types.md#gs_ingress_path_types) for more information.

By default, annotations with values beginning with:

* ``lbipam.cilium.io``
* ``nodeipam.cilium.io``
* ``service.beta.kubernetes.io``
* ``service.kubernetes.io``

will be copied from an Ingress object to the generated LoadBalancer Service objects.

This setting is controlled by the Cilium Operator's ``ingress-lb-annotation-prefixes``
config flag, and can be configured in Cilium's Helm ``values.yaml``
using the ``ingressController.ingressLBAnnotationPrefixes`` setting.

Please refer to the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer)
for more details.

<a id="gs_ingress_host_network_mode"></a>

## Host network mode
> **Note:**
> Supported since Cilium 1.16+

Host network mode allows you to expose the Cilium ingress controller (Envoy
listener) directly on the host network.
This is useful in cases where a LoadBalancer Service is unavailable, such
as in development environments or environments with cluster-external
loadbalancers.

> **Note:**
> * Enabling the Cilium ingress controller host network mode automatically disables the LoadBalancer/NodePort type Service mode. They are mutually exclusive.
> * The listener is exposed on all interfaces (``0.0.0.0`` for IPv4 and/or ``::`` for IPv6).

Host network mode can be enabled via Helm:

```yaml
ingressController:
  enabled: true
  hostNetwork:
    enabled: true
```

Once enabled, host network ports can be specified with the following methods:

* Shared Ingress: Globally via Helm flags
    * ``ingressController.hostNetwork.sharedListenerPort``: Host network port to expose the Cilium ingress controller Envoy listener. The default port is ``8080``. If you change it, you should choose a port number higher than ``1023`` (see [Bind to privileged port](ingress.md#bind-to-privileged-port)).
* Dedicated Ingress: Per ``Ingress`` resource via annotations
    * ``ingress.cilium.io/host-listener-port``:  Host network port to expose the Cilium ingress controller Envoy listener. The default port is ``8080`` but it can only be used for a single ``Ingress`` resource as it needs to be unique per ``Ingress`` resource. You should choose a port higher than ``1023`` (see [Bind to privileged port](ingress.md#bind-to-privileged-port)). This annotation is mandatory if the global Cilium ingress controller mode is configured to ``dedicated`` (``ingressController.loadbalancerMode``) or the ingress resource sets the ``ingress.cilium.io/loadbalancer-mode`` annotation to ``dedicated`` and multiple ``Ingress`` resources are deployed.

The default behavior regarding shared or dedicated ingress can be configured via
``ingressController.loadbalancerMode``.

> **Warning:**
> Be aware that misconfiguration might result in port clashes. Configure unique ports that are still available on all Cilium Nodes where Cilium ingress controller Envoy listeners are exposed.

### Bind to privileged port
By default, the Cilium L7 Envoy process does not have any Linux capabilities
out-of-the-box and is therefore not allowed to listen on privileged ports.

If you choose a port equal to or lower than ``1023``, ensure that the Helm value
``envoy.securityContext.capabilities.keepCapNetBindService=true`` is configured
and to add the capability ``NET_BIND_SERVICE`` to the respective
[Cilium Envoy container via Helm values](../../security/network/proxy/envoy.md#envoy):

* Standalone DaemonSet mode: ``envoy.securityContext.capabilities.envoy``
* Embedded mode: ``securityContext.capabilities.ciliumAgent``

Configure the following Helm values to allow privileged port bindings in host
network mode:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Standalone DaemonSet mode

     .. code-block:: yaml

         ingressController:
           enabled: true
           hostNetwork:
             enabled: true
         envoy:
           enabled: true
           securityContext:
             capabilities:
               keepCapNetBindService: true
               envoy:
               # Add NET_BIND_SERVICE to the list (keep the others!)
               - NET_BIND_SERVICE

   .. group-tab:: Embedded mode

     .. code-block:: yaml

         ingressController:
           enabled: true
           hostNetwork:
             enabled: true
         envoy:
           securityContext:
             capabilities:
               keepCapNetBindService: true
         securityContext:
           capabilities:
             ciliumAgent:
             # Add NET_BIND_SERVICE to the list (keep the others!)
             - NET_BIND_SERVICE

### Deploy Gateway API listeners on subset of nodes
The Cilium ingress controller Envoy listener can be exposed on a specific subset
of nodes. This only works in combination with the host network mode and can be
configured via a node label selector in the Helm values:

```yaml
ingressController:
  enabled: true
  hostNetwork:
    enabled: true
    nodes:
      matchLabels:
        role: infra
        component: ingress
```

This will deploy the Ingress Controller Envoy listener only on the Cilium Nodes
matching the configured labels. An empty selector selects all nodes and
continues to expose the functionality on all Cilium nodes.
