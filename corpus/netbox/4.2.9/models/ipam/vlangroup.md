# VLAN Groups

VLAN groups can be used to organize [VLANs](./vlan.md) within NetBox. Each VLAN group can be scoped to a particular [region](../dcim/region.md), [site group](../dcim/sitegroup.md), [site](../dcim/sitegroup.md), [location](../dcim/location.md), [rack](../dcim/rack.md), [cluster group](../virtualization/clustergroup.md), or [cluster](../virtualization/cluster.md). Member VLANs will be available for assignment to devices and/or virtual machines within the specified scope.

Groups can also be used to enforce uniqueness: Each VLAN within a group must have a unique ID and name. VLANs which are not assigned to a group may have overlapping names and IDs (including VLANs which belong to a common site). For example, two VLANs with ID 123 may be created, but they cannot both be assigned to the same group.

## Fields

### Name

A unique human-friendly name.

### Slug

A unique URL-friendly identifier. (This value can be used for filtering.)

### VLAN ID Ranges

The set of VLAN IDs which are encompassed by the group. By default, this will be the entire range of valid IEEE 802.1Q VLAN IDs (1 to 4094, inclusive). VLANs created within a group must have a VID that falls within one of these ranges. Ranges may not overlap.

### Scope

The domain covered by a VLAN group, defined as one of the supported object types. This conveys the context in which a VLAN group applies.
