<!-- overview -->

This page shows you how to run a single-instance stateful application
in Kubernetes using a PersistentVolume and a Deployment. The
application is MySQL.

## Objectives

- Create a PersistentVolume referencing a disk in your environment.
- Create a MySQL Deployment.
- Expose MySQL to other pods in the cluster at a known DNS name.

## Before you begin

- You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts. If you do not already have a
cluster, you can create one by using
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/)
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

* [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
* [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)
 

- You need to either have a [dynamic PersistentVolume provisioner](/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/) with a default
[StorageClass](/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/),
or [statically provision PersistentVolumes](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#provisioning)
yourself to satisfy the [PersistentVolumeClaims](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims)
used here.

## Deploy MySQL

You can run a stateful application by creating a Kubernetes Deployment
and connecting it to an existing PersistentVolume using a
PersistentVolumeClaim. For example, this YAML file describes a
Deployment that runs MySQL and references the PersistentVolumeClaim. The file
defines a volume mount for /var/lib/mysql, and then creates a
PersistentVolumeClaim that looks for a 20G volume. This claim is
satisfied by any existing volume that meets the requirements,
or by a dynamic provisioner.

Note: The password is defined in the config yaml, and this is insecure. See
[Kubernetes Secrets](/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)
for a secure solution.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: mysql:5.6
        name: mysql
        env:
          # Use secret in real usage
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-volume
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  capacity:
    storage: 20Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi
```

1. Deploy the PV and PVC of the YAML file:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/mysql/mysql-pv.yaml
   ```

1. Deploy the contents of the YAML file:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/mysql/mysql-deployment.yaml
   ```

1. Display information about the Deployment:

   ```shell
   kubectl describe deployment mysql
   ```

   The output is similar to this:

   ```
   Name:                 mysql
   Namespace:            default
   CreationTimestamp:    Tue, 01 Nov 2016 11:18:45 -0700

   Annotations:          deployment.kubernetes.io/revision=1
   Selector:             app=mysql
   Replicas:             1 desired | 1 updated | 1 total | 0 available | 1 unavailable
   StrategyType:         Recreate
   MinReadySeconds:      0
   Pod Template:
     Labels:       app=mysql
     Containers:
       mysql:
       Image:      mysql:5.6
       Port:       3306/TCP
       Environment:
         MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:      password
       Mounts:
         /var/lib/mysql from mysql-persistent-storage (rw)
     Volumes:
       mysql-persistent-storage:
       Type:       PersistentVolumeClaim (a reference to a PersistentVolumeClaim in the same namespace)

       ReadOnly:   false
   Conditions:

   OldReplicaSets:       <none>
   NewReplicaSet:        mysql-63082529 (1/1 replicas created)
   Events:
     FirstSeen    LastSeen    Count    From                SubobjectPath    Type        Reason            Message

   ```

1. List the pods created by the Deployment:

   ```shell
   kubectl get pods -l app=mysql
   ```

   The output is similar to this:

   ```
   NAME                   READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   mysql-63082529-2z3ki   1/1       Running   0          3m
   ```

1. Inspect the PersistentVolumeClaim:

   ```shell
   kubectl describe pvc mysql-pv-claim
   ```

   The output is similar to this:

   ```
   Name:         mysql-pv-claim
   Namespace:    default
   StorageClass:
   Status:       Bound
   Volume:       mysql-pv-volume
   Labels:       <none>
   Annotations:    pv.kubernetes.io/bind-completed=yes
                   pv.kubernetes.io/bound-by-controller=yes
   Capacity:     20Gi
   Access Modes: RWO
   Events:       <none>
   ```

## Accessing the MySQL instance

The preceding YAML file creates a service that
allows other Pods in the cluster to access the database. The Service option
`clusterIP: None` lets the Service DNS name resolve directly to the
Pod's IP address. This is optimal when you have only one Pod
behind a Service and you don't intend to increase the number of Pods.

Run a MySQL client to connect to the server:

```shell
kubectl run -it --rm --image=mysql:5.6 --restart=Never mysql-client -- mysql -h mysql -ppassword
```

This command creates a new Pod in the cluster running a MySQL client
and connects it to the server through the Service. If it connects, you
know your stateful MySQL database is up and running.

```
Waiting for pod default/mysql-client-274442439-zyp6i to be running, status is Pending, pod ready: false
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.

mysql>
```

## Updating

The image or any other part of the Deployment can be updated as usual
with the `kubectl apply` command. Here are some precautions that are
specific to stateful apps:

- Don't scale the app. This setup is for single-instance apps
  only. The underlying PersistentVolume can only be mounted to one
  Pod. For clustered stateful apps, see the
  [StatefulSet documentation](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/).
- Use `strategy:` `type: Recreate` in the Deployment configuration
  YAML file. This instructs Kubernetes to _not_ use rolling
  updates. Rolling updates will not work, as you cannot have more than
  one Pod running at a time. The `Recreate` strategy will stop the
  first pod before creating a new one with the updated configuration.

## Deleting a deployment

Delete the deployed objects by name:

```shell
kubectl delete deployment,svc mysql
kubectl delete pvc mysql-pv-claim
kubectl delete pv mysql-pv-volume
```

If you manually provisioned a PersistentVolume, you also need to manually
delete it, as well as release the underlying resource.
If you used a dynamic provisioner, it automatically deletes the
PersistentVolume when it sees that you deleted the PersistentVolumeClaim.
Some dynamic provisioners (such as those for EBS and PD) also release the
underlying resource upon deleting the PersistentVolume.
