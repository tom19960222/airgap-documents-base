<!-- overview -->
This page shows how to assign a Kubernetes Pod to a particular node using Node Affinity in a
Kubernetes cluster.

## Before you begin

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts. If you do not already have a
cluster, you can create one by using
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/)
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

* [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
* [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)
 

<!-- steps -->

## Add a label to a node

1. List the nodes in your cluster, along with their labels:

    ```shell
    kubectl get nodes --show-labels
    ```
    The output is similar to this:

    ```shell
    NAME      STATUS    ROLES    AGE     VERSION        LABELS
    worker0   Ready     <none>   1d      v1.13.0        ...,kubernetes.io/hostname=worker0
    worker1   Ready     <none>   1d      v1.13.0        ...,kubernetes.io/hostname=worker1
    worker2   Ready     <none>   1d      v1.13.0        ...,kubernetes.io/hostname=worker2
    ```
1. Choose one of your nodes, and add a label to it:

    ```shell
    kubectl label nodes <your-node-name> disktype=ssd
    ```
    where `<your-node-name>` is the name of your chosen node.

1. Verify that your chosen node has a `disktype=ssd` label:

    ```shell
    kubectl get nodes --show-labels
    ```

    The output is similar to this:

    ```
    NAME      STATUS    ROLES    AGE     VERSION        LABELS
    worker0   Ready     <none>   1d      v1.13.0        ...,disktype=ssd,kubernetes.io/hostname=worker0
    worker1   Ready     <none>   1d      v1.13.0        ...,kubernetes.io/hostname=worker1
    worker2   Ready     <none>   1d      v1.13.0        ...,kubernetes.io/hostname=worker2
    ```

    In the preceding output, you can see that the `worker0` node has a
    `disktype=ssd` label.

## Schedule a Pod using required node affinity

This manifest describes a Pod that has a `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` node affinity,`disktype: ssd`. 
This means that the pod will get scheduled only on a node that has a `disktype=ssd` label. 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd            
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

1. Apply the manifest to create a Pod that is scheduled onto your
   chosen node:
    
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/pod-nginx-required-affinity.yaml
    ```

1. Verify that the pod is running on your chosen node:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods --output=wide
    ```

    The output is similar to this:
    
    ```
    NAME     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE    IP           NODE
    nginx    1/1       Running   0          13s    10.200.0.4   worker0
    ```
    
## Schedule a Pod using preferred node affinity

This manifest describes a Pod that has a `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` node affinity,`disktype: ssd`. 
This means that the pod will prefer a node that has a `disktype=ssd` label. 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 1
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd          
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

1. Apply the manifest to create a Pod that is scheduled onto your
   chosen node:
    
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/pod-nginx-preferred-affinity.yaml
    ```

1. Verify that the pod is running on your chosen node:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods --output=wide
    ```

    The output is similar to this:
    
    ```
    NAME     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE    IP           NODE
    nginx    1/1       Running   0          13s    10.200.0.4   worker0
    ```
