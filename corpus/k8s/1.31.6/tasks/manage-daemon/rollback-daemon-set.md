<!-- overview -->

This page shows how to perform a rollback on a daemonset.

## Before you begin

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts. If you do not already have a
cluster, you can create one by using
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/)
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

* [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
* [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)
 

You should already know how to [perform a rolling update on a
 DaemonSet](/docs/tasks/manage-daemon/update-daemon-set/).

<!-- steps -->

## Performing a rollback on a DaemonSet

### Step 1: Find the DaemonSet revision you want to roll back to

You can skip this step if you only want to roll back to the last revision.

List all revisions of a DaemonSet:

```shell
kubectl rollout history daemonset <daemonset-name>
```

This returns a list of DaemonSet revisions:

```
daemonsets "<daemonset-name>"
REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE
1               ...
2               ...
...
```

* Change cause is copied from DaemonSet annotation `kubernetes.io/change-cause`
  to its revisions upon creation. You may specify `--record=true` in `kubectl`
  to record the command executed in the change cause annotation.

To see the details of a specific revision:

```shell
kubectl rollout history daemonset <daemonset-name> --revision=1
```

This returns the details of that revision:

```
daemonsets "<daemonset-name>" with revision #1
Pod Template:
Labels:       foo=bar
Containers:
app:
 Image:        ...
 Port:         ...
 Environment:  ...
 Mounts:       ...
Volumes:      ...
```

### Step 2: Roll back to a specific revision

```shell
# Specify the revision number you get from Step 1 in --to-revision
kubectl rollout undo daemonset <daemonset-name> --to-revision=<revision>
```

If it succeeds, the command returns:

```
daemonset "<daemonset-name>" rolled back
```

> **Note:**
>
> If `--to-revision` flag is not specified, kubectl picks the most recent revision.

### Step 3: Watch the progress of the DaemonSet rollback

`kubectl rollout undo daemonset` tells the server to start rolling back the
DaemonSet. The real rollback is done asynchronously inside the cluster
control plane.

To watch the progress of the rollback:

```shell
kubectl rollout status ds/<daemonset-name>
```

When the rollback is complete, the output is similar to:

```
daemonset "<daemonset-name>" successfully rolled out
```

## Understanding DaemonSet revisions

In the previous `kubectl rollout history` step, you got a list of DaemonSet
revisions. Each revision is stored in a resource named ControllerRevision.

To see what is stored in each revision, find the DaemonSet revision raw
resources:

```shell
kubectl get controllerrevision -l <daemonset-selector-key>=<daemonset-selector-value>
```

This returns a list of ControllerRevisions:

```
NAME                               CONTROLLER                     REVISION   AGE
<daemonset-name>-<revision-hash>   DaemonSet/<daemonset-name>     1          1h
<daemonset-name>-<revision-hash>   DaemonSet/<daemonset-name>     2          1h
```

Each ControllerRevision stores the annotations and template of a DaemonSet
revision.

`kubectl rollout undo` takes a specific ControllerRevision and replaces
DaemonSet template with the template stored in the ControllerRevision.
`kubectl rollout undo` is equivalent to updating DaemonSet template to a
previous revision through other commands, such as `kubectl edit` or `kubectl
apply`.

> **Note:**
>
> DaemonSet revisions only roll forward. That is to say, after a
> rollback completes, the revision number (`.revision` field) of the
> ControllerRevision being rolled back to will advance. For example, if you
> have revision 1 and 2 in the system, and roll back from revision 2 to revision
> 1, the ControllerRevision with `.revision: 1` will become `.revision: 3`.
