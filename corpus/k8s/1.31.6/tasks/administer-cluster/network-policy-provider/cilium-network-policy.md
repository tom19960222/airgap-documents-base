<!-- overview -->
This page shows how to use Cilium for NetworkPolicy.

For background on Cilium, read the [Introduction to Cilium](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/overview/intro).

## Before you begin

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts. If you do not already have a
cluster, you can create one by using
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/)
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

* [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
* [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)
 

<!-- steps -->
## Deploying Cilium on Minikube for Basic Testing

To get familiar with Cilium easily you can follow the
[Cilium Kubernetes Getting Started Guide](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/k8s-install-default/)
to perform a basic DaemonSet installation of Cilium in minikube.

To start minikube, minimal version required is >= v1.5.2, run the with the
following arguments:

```shell
minikube version
```
```
minikube version: v1.5.2
```

```shell
minikube start --network-plugin=cni
```

For minikube you can install Cilium using its CLI tool. To do so, first download the latest
version of the CLI with the following command:

```shell
curl -LO https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli/releases/latest/download/cilium-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Then extract the downloaded file to your `/usr/local/bin` directory with the following command:

```shell
sudo tar xzvfC cilium-linux-amd64.tar.gz /usr/local/bin
rm cilium-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

After running the above commands, you can now install Cilium with the following command: 

```shell
cilium install
```

Cilium will then automatically detect the cluster configuration and create and
install the appropriate components for a successful installation.
The components are:

- Certificate Authority (CA) in Secret `cilium-ca` and certificates for Hubble (Cilium's observability layer).
- Service accounts.
- Cluster roles.
- ConfigMap.
- Agent DaemonSet and an Operator Deployment.

After the installation, you can view the overall status of the Cilium deployment with the `cilium status` command.
See the expected output of the `status` command
[here](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/k8s-install-default/#validate-the-installation). 

The remainder of the Getting Started Guide explains how to enforce both L3/L4
(i.e., IP address + port) security policies, as well as L7 (e.g., HTTP) security
policies using an example application.

## Deploying Cilium for Production Use

For detailed instructions around deploying Cilium for production, see:
[Cilium Kubernetes Installation Guide](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/kubernetes/concepts/)
This documentation includes detailed requirements, instructions and example
production DaemonSet files.

<!-- discussion -->
##  Understanding Cilium components

Deploying a cluster with Cilium adds Pods to the `kube-system` namespace. To see
this list of Pods run:

```shell
kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=cilium
```

You'll see a list of Pods similar to this:

```console
NAME           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cilium-kkdhz   1/1     Running   0          3m23s
...
```

A `cilium` Pod runs on each node in your cluster and enforces network policy
on the traffic to/from Pods on that node using Linux BPF.

## What's next

Once your cluster is running, you can follow the
[Declare Network Policy](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/declare-network-policy/)
to try out Kubernetes NetworkPolicy with Cilium.
