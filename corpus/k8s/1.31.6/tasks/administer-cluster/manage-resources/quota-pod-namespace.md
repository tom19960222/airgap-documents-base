<!-- overview -->

This page shows how to set a quota for the total number of Pods that can run
in a Namespace. You specify quotas in a
[ResourceQuota](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/policy-resources/resource-quota-v1/)
object.

## Before you begin

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts. If you do not already have a
cluster, you can create one by using
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/)
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

* [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
* [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)

You must have access to create namespaces in your cluster.

<!-- steps -->

## Create a namespace

Create a namespace so that the resources you create in this exercise are
isolated from the rest of your cluster.

```shell
kubectl create namespace quota-pod-example
```

## Create a ResourceQuota

Here is an example manifest for a ResourceQuota:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: pod-demo
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "2"
```

Create the ResourceQuota:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/resource/quota-pod.yaml --namespace=quota-pod-example
```

View detailed information about the ResourceQuota:

```shell
kubectl get resourcequota pod-demo --namespace=quota-pod-example --output=yaml
```

The output shows that the namespace has a quota of two Pods, and that currently there are
no Pods; that is, none of the quota is used.

```yaml
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "2"
status:
  hard:
    pods: "2"
  used:
    pods: "0"
```

Here is an example manifest for a deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pod-quota-demo
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      purpose: quota-demo
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        purpose: quota-demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pod-quota-demo
        image: nginx
```

In that manifest, `replicas: 3` tells Kubernetes to attempt to create three new Pods, all
running the same application.

Create the Deployment:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/resource/quota-pod-deployment.yaml --namespace=quota-pod-example
```

View detailed information about the Deployment:

```shell
kubectl get deployment pod-quota-demo --namespace=quota-pod-example --output=yaml
```

The output shows that even though the Deployment specifies three replicas, only two
Pods were created because of the quota you defined earlier:

```yaml
spec:
  ...
  replicas: 3
...
status:
  availableReplicas: 2
...
lastUpdateTime: 2021-04-02T20:57:05Z
    message: 'unable to create pods: pods "pod-quota-demo-1650323038-" is forbidden:
      exceeded quota: pod-demo, requested: pods=1, used: pods=2, limited: pods=2'
```

### Choice of resource

In this task you have defined a ResourceQuota that limited the total number of Pods, but
you could also limit the total number of other kinds of object. For example, you
might decide to limit how many CronJobs
that can live in a single namespace.

## Clean up

Delete your namespace:

```shell
kubectl delete namespace quota-pod-example
```
