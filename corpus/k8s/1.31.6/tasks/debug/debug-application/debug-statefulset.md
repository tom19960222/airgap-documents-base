<!-- overview -->
This task shows you how to debug a StatefulSet.

## Before you begin

* You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
* You should have a StatefulSet running that you want to investigate.

<!-- steps -->

## Debugging a StatefulSet

In order to list all the pods which belong to a StatefulSet, which have a label `app.kubernetes.io/name=MyApp` set on them,
you can use the following:

```shell
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=MyApp
```

If you find that any Pods listed are in `Unknown` or `Terminating` state for an extended period of time,
refer to the [Deleting StatefulSet Pods](/docs/tasks/run-application/delete-stateful-set/) task for
instructions on how to deal with them.
You can debug individual Pods in a StatefulSet using the
[Debugging Pods](/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/debug-pods/) guide.
