<!-- overview -->

Each object in your cluster has a [_Name_](#names) that is unique for that type of resource.
Every Kubernetes object also has a [_UID_](#uids) that is unique across your whole cluster.

For example, you can only have one Pod named `myapp-1234` within the same [namespace](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/), but you can have one Pod and one Deployment that are each named `myapp-1234`.

For non-unique user-provided attributes, Kubernetes provides [labels](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) and [annotations](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/).

## Names

A client-provided string that refers to an object in a resource URL, such as `/api/v1/pods/some-name`.

 

Only one object of a given kind can have a given name at a time. However, if you delete the object, you can make a new object with the same name.

**Names must be unique across all [API versions](/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-groups-and-versioning)
of the same resource. API resources are distinguished by their API group, resource type, namespace
(for namespaced resources), and name. In other words, API version is irrelevant in this context.**

> **Note:**
>
> In cases when objects represent a physical entity, like a Node representing a physical host, when the host is re-created under the same name without deleting and re-creating the Node, Kubernetes treats the new host as the old one, which may lead to inconsistencies.

Below are four types of commonly used name constraints for resources.

### DNS Subdomain Names

Most resource types require a name that can be used as a DNS subdomain name
as defined in [RFC 1123](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123).
This means the name must:

- contain no more than 253 characters
- contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters, '-' or '.'
- start with an alphanumeric character
- end with an alphanumeric character

### RFC 1123 Label Names {#dns-label-names}

Some resource types require their names to follow the DNS
label standard as defined in [RFC 1123](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123).
This means the name must:

- contain at most 63 characters
- contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-'
- start with an alphanumeric character
- end with an alphanumeric character

### RFC 1035 Label Names

Some resource types require their names to follow the DNS
label standard as defined in [RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035).
This means the name must:

- contain at most 63 characters
- contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-'
- start with an alphabetic character
- end with an alphanumeric character

> **Note:**
>
> The only difference between the RFC 1035 and RFC 1123
> label standards is that RFC 1123 labels are allowed to
> start with a digit, whereas RFC 1035 labels can start
> with a lowercase alphabetic character only.

### Path Segment Names

Some resource types require their names to be able to be safely encoded as a
path segment. In other words, the name may not be "." or ".." and the name may
not contain "/" or "%".

Here's an example manifest for a Pod named `nginx-demo`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

> **Note:**
>
> Some resource types have additional restrictions on their names.

## UIDs

A Kubernetes systems-generated string to uniquely identify objects.

 

Every object created over the whole lifetime of a Kubernetes cluster has a distinct UID. It is intended to distinguish between historical occurrences of similar entities.

Kubernetes UIDs are universally unique identifiers (also known as UUIDs).
UUIDs are standardized as ISO/IEC 9834-8 and as ITU-T X.667.

## What's next

* Read about [labels](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) and [annotations](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) in Kubernetes.
* See the [Identifiers and Names in Kubernetes](https://git.k8s.io/design-proposals-archive/architecture/identifiers.md) design document.
