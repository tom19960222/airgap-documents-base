<!-- overview -->
This tutorial shows you how to run [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) on Kubernetes.
Cassandra, a database, needs persistent storage to provide data durability (application _state_).
In this example, a custom Cassandra seed provider lets the database discover new Cassandra instances as they join the Cassandra cluster.

*StatefulSets* make it easier to deploy stateful applications into your Kubernetes cluster.
For more information on the features used in this tutorial, see
[StatefulSet](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/).

> **Note:**
>
> Cassandra and Kubernetes both use the term _node_ to mean a member of a cluster. In this
> tutorial, the Pods that belong to the StatefulSet are Cassandra nodes and are members
> of the Cassandra cluster (called a _ring_). When those Pods run in your Kubernetes cluster,
> the Kubernetes control plane schedules those Pods onto Kubernetes
> Nodes.
>
> When a Cassandra node starts, it uses a _seed list_ to bootstrap discovery of other
> nodes in the ring.
> This tutorial deploys a custom Cassandra seed provider that lets the database discover
> new Cassandra Pods as they appear inside your Kubernetes cluster.

## Objectives

* Create and validate a Cassandra headless Service.
* Use a StatefulSet to create a Cassandra ring.
* Validate the StatefulSet.
* Modify the StatefulSet.
* Delete the StatefulSet and its Pods.

## Before you begin

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts. If you do not already have a
cluster, you can create one by using
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/)
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

* [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
* [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)

To complete this tutorial, you should already have a basic familiarity with
Pods,
Services, and
StatefulSets.

### Additional Minikube setup instructions

> **Caution:**
>
> [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) defaults to 2048MB of memory and 2 CPU.
> Running Minikube with the default resource configuration results in insufficient resource
> errors during this tutorial. To avoid these errors, start Minikube with the following settings:
>
> ```shell
> minikube start --memory 5120 --cpus=4
> ```

## Creating a headless Service for Cassandra {#creating-a-cassandra-headless-service}

In Kubernetes, a Service describes a set of
Pods that perform the same task.

The following Service is used for DNS lookups between Cassandra Pods and clients within your cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: cassandra
  name: cassandra
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  ports:
  - port: 9042
  selector:
    app: cassandra
```

Create a Service to track all Cassandra StatefulSet members from the `cassandra-service.yaml` file:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/cassandra/cassandra-service.yaml
```

### Validating (optional) {#validating}

Get the Cassandra Service.

```shell
kubectl get svc cassandra
```

The response is

```
NAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
cassandra   ClusterIP   None         <none>        9042/TCP   45s
```

If you don't see a Service named `cassandra`, that means creation failed. Read
[Debug Services](/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/debug-service/)
for help troubleshooting common issues.

## Using a StatefulSet to create a Cassandra ring

The StatefulSet manifest, included below, creates a Cassandra ring that consists of three Pods.

> **Note:**
>
> This example uses the default provisioner for Minikube.
> Please update the following StatefulSet for the cloud you are working with.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:

        # These volume mounts are persistent. They are like inline claims,

        volumeMounts:
        - name: cassandra-data
          mountPath: /cassandra_data
  # These are converted to volume claims by the controller
  # and mounted at the paths mentioned above.
  # do not use these in production until ssd GCEPersistentDisk or other ssd pd
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: cassandra-data
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: fast
      resources:
        requests:

```

Create the Cassandra StatefulSet from the `cassandra-statefulset.yaml` file:

```shell
# Use this if you are able to apply cassandra-statefulset.yaml unmodified
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/cassandra/cassandra-statefulset.yaml
```

If you need to modify `cassandra-statefulset.yaml` to suit your cluster, download
https://k8s.io/examples/application/cassandra/cassandra-statefulset.yaml and then apply
that manifest, from the folder you saved the modified version into:
```shell
# Use this if you needed to modify cassandra-statefulset.yaml locally
kubectl apply -f cassandra-statefulset.yaml
```

## Validating the Cassandra StatefulSet

1. Get the Cassandra StatefulSet:

    ```shell
    kubectl get statefulset cassandra
    ```

    The response should be similar to:

    ```
    NAME        DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE
    cassandra   3         0         13s
    ```

    The `StatefulSet` resource deploys Pods sequentially.

1. Get the Pods to see the ordered creation status:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -l="app=cassandra"
    ```

    The response should be similar to:

    ```shell
    NAME          READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    cassandra-0   1/1       Running             0          1m
    cassandra-1   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          8s
    ```

    It can take several minutes for all three Pods to deploy. Once they are deployed, the same command
    returns output similar to:

    ```
    NAME          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    cassandra-0   1/1       Running   0          10m
    cassandra-1   1/1       Running   0          9m
    cassandra-2   1/1       Running   0          8m
    ```

3. Run the Cassandra [nodetool](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA2/NodeTool) inside the first Pod, to
   display the status of the ring.

    ```shell
    kubectl exec -it cassandra-0 -- nodetool status
    ```

    The response should look something like:

    ```
    Datacenter: DC1-K8Demo
    ======================
    Status=Up/Down
    |/ State=Normal/Leaving/Joining/Moving
    --  Address     Load       Tokens       Owns (effective)  Host ID                               Rack
    UN  172.17.0.5  83.57 KiB  32           74.0%             e2dd09e6-d9d3-477e-96c5-45094c08db0f  Rack1-K8Demo

    UN  172.17.0.6  84.74 KiB  32           67.1%             a6a1e8c2-3dc5-4417-b1a0-26507af2aaad  Rack1-K8Demo
    ```

## Modifying the Cassandra StatefulSet

Use `kubectl edit` to modify the size of a Cassandra StatefulSet.

1. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl edit statefulset cassandra
    ```

    This command opens an editor in your terminal. The line you need to change is the `replicas` field.
    The following sample is an excerpt of the StatefulSet file:

    ```yaml
    # Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
    # and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
    # reopened with the relevant failures.

    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: StatefulSet
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: 2016-08-13T18:40:58Z
      generation: 1
      labels:
      app: cassandra
      name: cassandra
      namespace: default
      resourceVersion: "323"
      uid: 7a219483-6185-11e6-a910-42010a8a0fc0
    spec:
      replicas: 3
    ```

1. Change the number of replicas to 4, and then save the manifest.

    The StatefulSet now scales to run with 4 Pods.

1. Get the Cassandra StatefulSet to verify your change:

    ```shell
    kubectl get statefulset cassandra
    ```

    The response should be similar to:

    ```
    NAME        DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE
    cassandra   4         4         36m
    ```

## Cleaning up

Deleting or scaling a StatefulSet down does not delete the volumes associated with the StatefulSet.
This setting is for your safety because your data is more valuable than automatically purging all related StatefulSet resources.

> **Warning:**
>
> Depending on the storage class and reclaim policy, deleting the *PersistentVolumeClaims* may cause the associated volumes
> to also be deleted. Never assume you'll be able to access data if its volume claims are deleted.

1. Run the following commands (chained together into a single command) to delete everything in the Cassandra StatefulSet:

    ```shell
    grace=$(kubectl get pod cassandra-0 -o=jsonpath='{.spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds}') \
      && kubectl delete statefulset -l app=cassandra \
      && echo "Sleeping ${grace} seconds" 1>&2 \
      && sleep $grace \
      && kubectl delete persistentvolumeclaim -l app=cassandra
    ```

1. Run the following command to delete the Service you set up for Cassandra:

    ```shell
    kubectl delete service -l app=cassandra
    ```

## Cassandra container environment variables

The Pods in this tutorial use the [`gcr.io/google-samples/cassandra:v13`](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/blob/master/cassandra/image/Dockerfile)
image from Google's [container registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/).
The Docker image above is based on [debian-base](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/tree/master/images/build/debian-base)
and includes OpenJDK 8.

This image includes a standard Cassandra installation from the Apache Debian repo.
By using environment variables you can change values that are inserted into `cassandra.yaml`.

| Environment variable     | Default value    |
| ------------------------ |:---------------: |
| `CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME` | `'Test Cluster'` |
| `CASSANDRA_NUM_TOKENS`   | `32`             |
| `CASSANDRA_RPC_ADDRESS`  | `0.0.0.0`        |
